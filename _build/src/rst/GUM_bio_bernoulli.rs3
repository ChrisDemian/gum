		<segment id="2" parent="112" relname="span">Daniel Bernoulli FRS ( German pronunciation : [ bɛʁˈnʊli ] ; 8 February 1700 – 17 March 1782 ) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family .</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="64" relname="span">He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics , especially fluid mechanics , and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics .</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli 's principle , a particular example of the conservation of energy , which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century : the carburetor and the airplane wing .</segment>

		<segment id="6" parent="101" relname="preparation">Early life</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="78" relname="background">Frontpage of Hydrodynamica ( 1738 )</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="117" relname="span">Daniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen , in the Netherlands , into a family of distinguished mathematicians .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="115" relname="concession">The Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp , at that time in the Spanish Netherlands ,</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="115" relname="span">but emigrated</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="10" relname="purpose">to escape the Spanish persecution of the Huguenots .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="118" relname="sequence">After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel , in Switzerland .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="118" relname="elaboration">Daniel was a son of Johann Bernoulli ( one of the " early developers " of calculus ) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli ( who " was the first to discover the theory of probability " ) .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="15" relname="background">He had two brothers , Niklaus and Johann II .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="71" relname="span">Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as " by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis " .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="120" relname="span">He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="18" relname="circumstance">Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris ,</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="72" relname="span">Johann , unable to bear the " shame " of being compared Daniel 's equal , banned Daniel from his house .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="67" relname="joint">Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel 's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="120" relname="result">Despite Daniel 's attempts at reconciliation , his father carried the grudge until his death .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="104" relname="span">Around schooling age , his father , Johann , encouraged him to study business ,</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="cause">there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="73" relname="span">However , Daniel refused ,</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="23" relname="cause">because he wanted to study mathematics .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="74" relname="sequence">He later gave in to his father 's wish and studied business .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="27" relname="cause">His father then asked him to study in medicine ,</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="75" relname="span">and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately , which they continued for some time .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="75" relname="result">Daniel studied medicine at Basel , Heidelberg , and Strasbourg , and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721 .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="30" relname="background">He was a contemporary and close friend of Leonhard Euler .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="107" relname="span">He went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics , but was very unhappy there ,</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="106" relname="span">and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="77" relname="span">He returned to the University of Basel ,</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="32" relname="elaboration">where he successively held the chairs of medicine , metaphysics , and natural philosophy until his death .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="74" relname="sequence">In May , 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="99" relname="preparation">Mathematical work</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="82" relname="span">His earliest mathematical work was the Exercitationes ( Mathematical Exercises ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="36" relname="elaboration">published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="83" relname="sequence">Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="84" relname="span">His chief work is Hydrodynamica ,</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="39" relname="elaboration">published in 1738 ;</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="121" relname="span">it resembles Joseph Louis Lagrange 's Mécanique Analytique</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="justify">in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle , namely , conservation of energy .</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="86" relname="span">This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides , to which , conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and Colin Maclaurin , a prize was awarded by the French Academy :</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="43" relname="elaboration">these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of Isaac Newton 's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and the investigations of Pierre-Simon Laplace .</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="99" relname="joint">Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions , especially on problems connected with vibrating strings , and the solutions given by Brook Taylor and by Jean le Rond d'Alembert .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="87" relname="span">Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids .</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="46" relname="elaboration">In particular , they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure .</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="49" relname="purpose">To investigate this ,</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="88" relname="span">Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid 's pressure in the pipe .</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="109" relname="result">Soon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients ' blood pressure by sticking point-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries .</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="111" relname="span">It was not until about 170 years later , in 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered a less painful method which is still in use today .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="90" relname="span">However , Bernoulli 's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="52" relname="purpose">to measure the speed of the air passing the plane ; that is its air speed .</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="55" relname="result">Taking his discoveries further ,</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="91" relname="span">Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy .</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="93" relname="background">It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height .</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="93" relname="span">Daniel realised that in a similar way , a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="92" relname="span">Mathematically this law is now written : ½ ρ u 2 + P = constant</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="58" relname="background">where P is pressure , ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity .</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="95" relname="background">A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls .</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="95" relname="span">This is exploited by the wing of an aeroplane which is designed to create an area above its surface where the air velocity increases .</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="63" relname="cause">The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing ,</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="96" relname="span">so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing .</segment>
