		<!--Tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers . Past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity , including ethnic , racial , and gender diversity . As an example , research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers . Additionally , diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [ 4 ] , which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists . Despite these positive effects , however , quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult , due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce .-->
