		<segment id="8" parent="148" relname="background">In fact , many , if not all , the markers of expertise identified by philosophers enjoy widespread recognition .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="148" relname="span">The fact that these criteria are widely known , however , offers an opportunity to those who would use them for deception , witting or unwitting .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="11" relname="justify">Since expertise must be assessed through indirect markers ,</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="85" relname="span">to mimic the markers of expertise is to mimic expertise [ 17 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="150" relname="span">We live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a means of inflating their pretense to expertise .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="12" relname="result">This fact , together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur , reduces ordinary people ’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="96" relname="span">For instance , those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise ,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="94" relname="span">taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="purpose">to ensure that people are taken in .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="97" relname="span">There are some egregious examples of this practice in the field of health care .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="90" relname="span">For example , a small number of doctors set up the American College of Pediatricians ( ACPeds )</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="18" relname="purpose">to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="125" relname="concession">Such an organization is surely permissible ,</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="102" relname="span">but it has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="cause">by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="104" relname="circumstance">Thus , when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [ 21 ] ,</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="104" relname="span">many people mistook the organization ’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians —</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="24" relname="antithesis">although the peak body for pediatric workers , the American Academy of Pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="27" relname="condition">Insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise ,</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="122" relname="span">it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="29" relname="circumstance">When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession ,</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="123" relname="span">it introduces an epistemic pollutant .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="118" relname="span">A yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="30" relname="purpose">in the interest of promoting the companies ’ commercial products [ 23 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="121" relname="span">The companies hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="32" relname="purpose">to endow their promotional “ research ” with an air of reliability .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="115" relname="circumstance">When the deceit was uncovered ,</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="114" relname="preparation">however , the effect was just the opposite :</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="37" relname="antithesis">the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by Elsevier ,</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="114" relname="span">but rather the legitimacy of Elsevier ’s publications — and , by extension , all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="154" relname="span">More recently , institutions of academic expertise have been subject to a large and growing outbreak of so-called predatory journals — journals that will publish almost anything for a fee .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="146" relname="span">Once again , this phenomenon has the effect of making peer-reviewed journals appear less legitimate .</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="130" relname="joint">At times , even those who work in academia may be unsure of a particular journal ’s legitimacy ,</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="130" relname="joint">and there are genuine borderline cases .</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="132" relname="span">For example , the Frontiers contingent of journals appears legitimate — at least to me —</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="42" relname="concession">despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee . 8</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="106" relname="span">Yet some Frontiers journals appear to have engaged in bad behavior ,</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="44" relname="purpose">whether for profit or for some other motive .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="106" relname="evidence">Frontiers in Public Health controversially published articles linking vaccines and autism [ 24 ] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [ 25 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="48" relname="cause">Whether due to this behavior or not ,</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="109" relname="span">Jeffrey Beall decided to add the publisher to his influential ( but now sadly unavailable ) list of questionable journals [ 26 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="152" relname="evaluation">The controversy surrounding Beall ’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals .</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="51" relname="justify">If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate ,</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="137" relname="span">one can not reasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="53" relname="condition">If their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution ,</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="139" relname="span">one can hardly blame them .</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="55" relname="justify">Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise ,</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="155" relname="span">it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions .</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="75" relname="span">Epistemic pollution may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions . 9</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="144" relname="span">For example , pollution may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="141" relname="span">Consider institutions with a credentialing function , such as universities , bar associations , or peer review bodies .</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="95" relname="span">These institutions do not exist</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="59" relname="purpose">solely to credential experts .</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="160" relname="span">They have other functions ,</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="78" relname="span">and these functions may come into conflict ,</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="62" relname="result">creating pressures to inflate credentials .</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="158" relname="span">For example , universities have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff ,</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="76" relname="joint">thereby increasing their rankings ,</segment>
		<segment id="66" parent="76" relname="joint">bringing in grant money ,</segment>
		<segment id="67" parent="76" relname="joint">and attracting students .</segment>
		<segment id="68" parent="112" relname="span">Systems that assess expertise can be manipulated ,</segment>
		<segment id="69" parent="111" relname="span">and many cases of such manipulation exist —</segment>
		<segment id="70" parent="69" relname="evidence">take the recent example by the University of Malaysia , which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [ 28 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="71" parent="113" relname="joint">For this reason , institutions may also be slow to investigate accusations of fraud ,</segment>
		<segment id="72" parent="110" relname="span">and they may try to keep their discoveries in-house</segment>
