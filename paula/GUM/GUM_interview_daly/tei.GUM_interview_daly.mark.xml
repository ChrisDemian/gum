I am curious about the population structure of the " fields " of anemones - the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually , and it 's possible that the fields are " clones " produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction . DNA is the only way to test this .-->
