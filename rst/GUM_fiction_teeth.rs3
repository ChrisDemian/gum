		<segment id="2" parent="94" relname="span">Steven wanted to be a dentist .</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="77" relname="span">It was pretty much the first thing he told us</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="circumstance">when , as first years , we were all bunched together in the unfamiliar dusty classroom .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="6" relname="circumstance">When , a couple of weeks later we were invited over to his house</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="95" relname="span">we saw that this was not an idle remark .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="78" relname="contrast">Where our bedroom walls were decorated with posters of pop stars and footballers ,</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="78" relname="contrast">Steven had diagrams setting out tooth implementations , anatomical drawings of the jaw with brightly coloured nerves , muscle , blood vessels , bones , and , of course , teeth .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="79" relname="contrast">Where we had shelves of plastic dinosaurs and superhero figurines from cornflake boxes ,</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="79" relname="contrast">Steven had plaster casts of jawbones , gums and teeth grinning down at us .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="96" relname="span">The instruments were locked away in glass cabinets</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">and only his parents had the key .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="97" relname="span">“ They do n’t exactly encourage my interest , ” he shrugged .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">“ They sort of tolerate it .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="98" relname="cause">But Dad says they ’re a sort of collection , and too expensive for me to play with . ”</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="17" relname="concession">Of course , we tried to pick the locks ,</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="100" relname="span">but the spikes and saws and drillheads remained — tantalisingly — out of reach .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="108" relname="span">We did n’t see Steven ’s interest as strange , well , not that much .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="105" relname="background">We all had our own interests — drawing , electronics , collecting beer caps — that each appeared obscure to anyone else .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="105" relname="span">DIY Dentistry was just something that had never crossed our horizon before .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="22" relname="justify">And if Steven did n’t see it as weird , or no weirder than Andy showing us his Eastern-Block beer caps all laid out neatly on cork boards with little hand-written labels ,</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="104" relname="span">why should it bother us ?</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="107" relname="span">I suppose that , in our own way , we were all collectively strange .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="25" relname="cause">The bunch that no one picked for their side at football or hockey ,</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="106" relname="span">and that was the glue that held us together .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="137" relname="span">Besides , Steven had some really good stuff :</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="139" relname="span">sweets that stained your teeth bright red — well , technically , not your teeth , just the plaque , but the result was often the same .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="81" relname="span">It took a few days good brushing to get it off .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="28" relname="concession">Well , most of it anyway .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="138" relname="joint">He had effervescent tablets that turned the canteen drinking water into that exact same pink mixture that the dentist gave you to rinse your mouth out after scraping around inside , and guaranteed to make the other kids splutter and spit it out when the taste slowly percolated through and met the memory of their last checkup .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="141" relname="preparation">Then there was the event that became the rite of passage into our group of misfits and outcasts :</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="141" relname="span">making a mould of your teeth .</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="34" relname="background">It was inevitable that one of us , seeing the plaster casts on the shelf by Steven ’s bed would ask how they were done .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="110" relname="span">It was just as inevitable that a few minutes later , Steven would be mixing up various powders and liquids , and pouring them into a horse-shoe shaped contraption .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="84" relname="span">It was n’t dangerous .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="35" relname="concession">At least , I suppose so .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="143" relname="joint">It was vaguely uncomfortable ,</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="142" relname="span">and appeared sufficiently disturbing that we all volunteered each other in turn</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="38" relname="circumstance">until , at last , Andy said he was game .</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="121" relname="preparation">And we were off .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="111" relname="joint">The hardest part was probably to overcome the gagging reflex that set in when you bit down into the acrid resin jelly and it flowed out and up and around , over teeth , gums and tongue .</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="111" relname="joint">Your nose filled with what you imagined were fumes from the warm paste .</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="111" relname="joint">And you seemed to be suddenly drowning in your own saliva .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="86" relname="span">Things generally got better</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="44" relname="circumstance">when Steven reminded you that you could actually breathe , and swallow , normally .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="87" relname="span">He watched the second hand trotting round the dial of his watch</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="46" relname="elaboration">mouthing the quarters ,</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="88" relname="span">before poking the setting goo</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="48" relname="purpose">to check its consistency .</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="51" relname="condition">Then , when he gave you the nod ,</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="124" relname="span">you tried to prise your jaws apart .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="53" relname="cause">As the seal around your gums and teeth was pretty solid ,</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="123" relname="span">you thought it would never come off ,</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="123" relname="circumstance">as the others giggled at your expressions and grimaces .</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="90" relname="span">Steven jiggled the handle that stuck out beyond your front teeth like some metallic duck ’s bill ,</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="55" relname="elaboration">turning and twisting it most professionally and murmuring encouragements .</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="126" relname="span">And , then , with an awful sucking slurp , it came free .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="91" relname="contrast">The initiated then revelled in retelling the gross sensation of having this evil-smelling plastic slug invade your mouth ,</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="91" relname="contrast">while the others waited their turn with mixed trepidation and excitement .</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="122" relname="sequence">Raucous laughter greeted the suggestions of the other body parts that could receive the same treatment .</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="146" relname="evaluation">The next part of the proceedings was less thrilling .</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="146" relname="sequence">Steven measured and mixed the plaster of Paris</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="147" relname="span">and prepared for the cast</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="148" relname="span">by using a bright blue putty</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="64" relname="purpose">to build up the form of the jaw ,</segment>
		<segment id="66" parent="149" relname="joint">and shoring up gaps and holes .</segment>
		<segment id="67" parent="150" relname="span">It get even less exciting</segment>
		<segment id="68" parent="67" relname="justify">when he said we ’d have to wait an hour while the plaster set real solid .</segment>
		<segment id="69" parent="151" relname="span">But the next time we visited his room we got to marvel at our toothy grins labelled and lined up on the shelf .</segment>
		<segment id="70" parent="113" relname="span">We were all perfectly happy with the result ,</segment>
		<segment id="71" parent="70" relname="elaboration">even wanting one as a trophy</segment>
		<segment id="72" parent="114" relname="span">until Steven passed an expert eye over them ,</segment>
		<segment id="73" parent="72" relname="elaboration">pointing out here a gap , here a filling , and there a completely misaligned incisor .</segment>
		<segment id="74" parent="152" relname="span">We were , he told us , mediocre specimens for his collection .</segment>
		<segment id="75" parent="129" relname="span">It did n’t matter .</segment>
		<segment id="76" parent="75" relname="justify">We were all friends , a group bonded by the common experience of being able to see our teeth on Steven ’s shelf .</segment>
