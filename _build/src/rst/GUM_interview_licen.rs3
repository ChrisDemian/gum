		<segment id="5" parent="56" relname="span">Ličen has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="5" relname="purpose">to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="37" relname="joint">Originally from Slovenia , he served as the Director of Media and Communications of a WTA Tour event and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="37" relname="joint">He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="43" relname="solutionhood">Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia , the United Kingdom and even Canada ?</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="57" relname="span">Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="60" relname="span">It emphasizes consumerism , the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities , dedication and qualifications , and reinforces , rather than changes , existing ideas related to gender , ethnicity and nationality .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="58" relname="span">Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="61" relname="span">because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="15" relname="concession">Although disability is not contagious ,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="59" relname="span">interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="38" relname="joint">Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication , hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="62" relname="span">Other countries , including the ones you mention , have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="19" relname="concession">Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act ,</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="36" relname="span">many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="47" relname="solutionhood">What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time ?</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="40" relname="preparation">The impact depends on a number of aspects .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="63" relname="span">One of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="22" relname="elaboration">Will they be shown nationally or regionally , on NBC or on any of the company ’s multiple cable networks ?</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="67" relname="span">A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="26" relname="background">Remember that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and New York , and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="68" relname="span">So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night , and evening prime-time events will be shown — indeed live — in the morning U.S. time .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="69" relname="span">So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="66" relname="span">A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="41" relname="joint">: will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics ?</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="41" relname="joint">Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse ?</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="65" relname="span">Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="31" relname="circumstance">while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity ?</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="44" relname="span">All in all , I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="70" relname="span">; but we will have to wait until after the event</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="34" relname="purpose">to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations .</segment>
