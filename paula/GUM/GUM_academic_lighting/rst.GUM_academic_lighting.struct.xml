		<!--Utilization of busted CFL in developing cheap and efficient segmented compact LED bulbs N S Andres and R T Ponce Electrical Engineering Department , Bataan Peninsula State University , 2100 , Balanga City Bataan , Philippines Abstract . Today ’s generation will not survive a day without the help of lighting . In fact , someone ’s productivity , particularly at night , depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity . Lighting takes a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy particularly in the Philippines . There are different type of lighting bulbs used at home can affect the overall lighting consumption . Nowadays , most commonly and widely used bulb in the household is the Compact Fluorescent Light ( CFL ) . However , the main problem of CFL is the mercury they contain . In addition to this is the harmful effect of mercury such as Emission of UV Radiation . In response to the said problem , this project study gives solution to the problem of the society concerning environment , health and safety as well energy conservation , by developing a segmented compact light-emitting diode ( SCLED ) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient , economical , and does not contain toxic chemicals . 1.
