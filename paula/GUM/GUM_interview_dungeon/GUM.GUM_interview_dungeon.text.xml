<body>BDSM as business : An interview with the owners of a dungeon Sunday , October 21 , 2007 Operating the business The costs Clothing supply closet . There &apos;s a misconception in this industry . Your exposure to this is probably primarily what you see in movies , scanning magazines , scanning the Internet , just snippets everywhere . It &apos;s portrayed as though it &apos;s dark , black and evil . And -- Oh man , well ? What &apos;s up ? I do wear a lot of black . It &apos;s anything but that . If you look at the rooms , there &apos;s all the accouterments you &apos;d find in these types of places -- but more than anything , there &apos;s a lot of good feeling around here . We hire the opposite of what you &apos;d think we would hire , what the average person would think we would hire . We hire educated , nice people . I remember one of our ads that I had put in said , &quot; If you think nice girls do n&apos;t do S&amp;M , &quot; -- I forgot what the rest of it said -- &quot; -- think again . &quot; Yeah , &quot; think again &quot; or something like that . And that ad had pulled so many girls , because they -- I think they all thought that nice girls do n&apos;t do this . And a bunch of them had called and they said , &quot; Wow . &quot; And I think I remember , a bunch of guys called because of that also . Do you remember ? I sure do , I sure do . What are the startup costs involved ? It varies ; look around Manhattan , look around rents , look around build-outs , look around hiring , look around advertising ... What &apos;s your greatest non-fixed cost ? The single most costly thing we spend on is rent and advertising , those two together make up the bulk of what we spend . There &apos;s supplies , and there &apos;s wear and tear and maintenance , and bookkeeping and things like that that you have to do . That &apos;s about it . The hardest thing in running this business , which is why people ca n&apos;t do it , is the relationship that my wife has with the gals and with the customers . Where do you advertise ? A lot on the web , we &apos;ve used most of the local city papers , New York Press , things like that , L Magazine . In the back of the paper ? Typically in the back of the paper . Magazines constantly change their policy on it ; they want it , they do n&apos;t want it ... Depending on the election year -- Who &apos;s buying the paper , who &apos;s selling the paper . So it changes , so one year we got to be in the Press , but they have now stopped adult ads . Completely . So now we &apos;ll be in the Voice for a while . We &apos;re moving more towards the Internet at this point , because the Internet is a much easier , safer way for a person to look at sensitive material and not get caught with it . Hiring employees Personality test questions given to prospective mistresses . Pursuant to your business question : we only hire nice people . I do n&apos;t care if a girl is absolutely exquisite looking -- My husband has met beautiful , beautiful girls -- -- beautiful girls -- -- and he &apos;s in the end , he would say , &quot; Well , I wo n&apos;t hire them . &quot; I &apos;m like , ‘ Are you insane ? I wo n&apos;t hire them . I hire -- Why not ? Because I want someone who &apos;s going to treat people nicely and well . We have -- How can you tell whether they will or will not ? Just by talking to them ? Having been a psychologist for a number of years gives me a leg up on it . And he &apos;s been right . And I have made him hire these girls , and ultimately he &apos;s been right They &apos;ve been complete pain in the asses ! I also have a profile they fill out for me , a mini-MMPI that I developed , so that I have an idea -- Rebecca and I put it together I do n&apos;t know if you &apos;d like to see one . No , no , no . Just -- I could show you . So I have a mini-MMPI that I -- Could I have a sample , not necessarily one that &apos;s filled out , but just one that you -- I &apos;ll show you . The questions are -- Be careful . He &apos;ll make you fill one out . You &apos;d be scared . You would n&apos;t hire me . Is it only girls you hire ? Yeah . What would a question like &quot; the greatest woman in the world &quot; reveal to you ? No question would reveal anything independently of all the questions together -- Sure . -- but I have a chart that I &apos;ll go through ; the MMPI . The baseline data that I use to -- How did you originate these questions ? Where did I make them ? You get a baseline from asking girls and refining profiles -- And it &apos;s an amalgamation of questions . Of many , many questions -- What &apos;s your favorite question ? I do n&apos;t know , the O.J. Simpson …. Yeah , I see O.J. Simpson . What would that be an indicator of ? I &apos;m not sure which one you gave him , but there &apos;s a brief , brief , brief IQ test there . Very brief . Do you ask for references ? No , because I really ca n&apos;t call and tell them I &apos;m yeah , so-and-so &apos;s applying here for a position . </body>
