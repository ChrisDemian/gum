		<!--Great question . The short answer is that we do n't know . The long answer is a bit more complicated . Here 's what we know . The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used to first detect and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles streaming into the solar system . ( This is a kind of " wind " of interstellar dust , caused by the fact that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium . ) Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the " cruise " phase of the interplanetary orbit in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind . He estimated that there should be around 45 particles , but this number is very uncertain — I would n't be surprised if it is quite different from that . That was the long answer ! One thing that I should say ... is that like all research , the outcome of what we are doing is highly uncertain . There is a wonderful quote attributed to Einstein — " If we knew what we were doing , it would n't be called " research " , would it ? "-->
