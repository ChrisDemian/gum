		<segment id="1" parent="60" relname="preparation">4. Discussion .</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="86" relname="span">We hypothesized that the children , who were over the age of six at the time of collection , would have adult-like SI interpretations .</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="2" relname="elaboration">We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments , and would result in adult-like interpretations .</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="93" relname="joint">Further , we posited that if our initial hypothesis was not supported , and in fact there was some non-adult-like performance , that there would be significant variability among the conditions , with cardinal numbers having the highest performance and some the weakest .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="57" relname="joint">On the surface , it does seem as if there is variability</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="57" relname="joint">and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding ( see limitations below ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="87" relname="span">but at least for this study , the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="94" relname="contrast">Significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="81" relname="preparation">4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="88" relname="span">This study is limited in its power and generalizability .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="10" relname="evaluation">It serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="67" relname="span">Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="12" relname="concession">despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people using them .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="68" relname="span">Future studies need to include more participants and more items</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="14" relname="purpose">to increase power .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="69" relname="span">Future studies should also include a larger age range of children</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="16" relname="purpose">to document the age at which adult-like performance emerges .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="64" relname="contrast">Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power ,</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="64" relname="contrast">but interesting trends ( e.g. , Nedwick , 2014 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="100" relname="span">Follow-up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="65" relname="contrast">In a future study , it is also important to consider if additional training in the difference between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments would impact results ,</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="65" relname="contrast">or if more naturalistic experimental conditions ( e.g. , demonstrating actions using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions ) would be beneficial .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="55" relname="background">Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior ( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , &amp; Grigorenko , 2016 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="55" relname="contrast">The current study is too small to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods ;</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="55" relname="contrast">however , in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="56" relname="span">In the current study , the responses from two children were not included</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="26" relname="cause">because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="56" relname="elaboration">More specifically , they answered “ yes ” that the puppet described the pictures well .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="91" relname="span">It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions , and in this regard , are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="72" relname="span">This is unlikely</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="30" relname="evidence">as they said that even the first training item was said well .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="75" relname="joint">It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors , or be polite ,</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="74" relname="span">and that “ yes ” was in some ways a default answer to be provided</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="33" relname="circumstance">when having to respond verbally in a test context .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="77" relname="preparation">Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="76" relname="antithesis">The puppets used were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="76" relname="joint">Upon arrival at the school , however , it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="76" relname="joint">and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="98" relname="preparation">Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting .</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="53" relname="contrast">Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="53" relname="contrast">while numbers greater than five are typically indicated using English borrowings .</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="51" relname="span">The cardinal numbers included in this study were only one through five</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="42" relname="purpose">in order to avoid additional item variability ,</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="97" relname="span">but larger numbers should be included in future research .</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="101" relname="preparation">5. Conclusion .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="47" relname="concession">Albeit limited ,</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="49" relname="span">these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research , but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="49" relname="evaluation">This interesting combination of findings – expected hierarchy of difficulty , but differing age of acquisition – is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI and could be the result of language-specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences .</segment>
