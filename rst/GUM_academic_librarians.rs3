		<segment id="5" parent="54" relname="span">In 2015 , an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium ,</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration">based on the example of the American communal space of librarians , archivists , LIS graduate students , and information specialists</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="54" relname="purpose">to discuss topics ‘ Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet ’ .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="58" relname="span">At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not ( yet ) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="57" relname="joint">On the administrative level , the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries ( UKB ) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="59" relname="sequence">A year later , the National Library of the Netherlands ( Koninklijke Bibliotheek ) , and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="61" relname="span">Therefore both institutes joined forces</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="61" relname="purpose">to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="62" relname="sequence">The two institutes were later joined by the Leiden University Libraries .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="62" relname="evaluation">We see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians , but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="63" relname="span">In essence , we want to teach our country ’s librarians the ins and outs of DH</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="purpose">in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="66" relname="span">The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH , for a diverse group of librarians , consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="17" relname="purpose">The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students , identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and ( perhaps ) to automate their daily library work .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="67" relname="antithesis">We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers ,</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="67" relname="joint">but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable providing information about DH projects ,</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="67" relname="joint">follow the literature and research ,</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="67" relname="joint">follow online tutorials</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="68" relname="span">and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="23" relname="elaboration">by engaging with the DH community .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="26" relname="purpose">In order to design this curriculum</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="70" relname="span">we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud - principle ( Williams , 2010 ) :</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="47" relname="joint">Desk research about what being a DH librarian entails ( e.g. Hartsell-Gundy et al. , 2015 ; Mulligan , 2016 ; also see the Zotero library of the LIBER Digital Humanities working group ) ;</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="47" relname="joint">Identify possible subjects , based on experience , a comparison of existing teaching material related to DH ( e.g. The Programming Historian , the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University 's Developing Librarian project ) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities ;</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="48" relname="span">Get feedback from researchers on possible subjects ,</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="29" relname="elaboration">based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need ;</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="49" relname="span">Get feedback from librarians on possible subjects ,</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="31" relname="elaboration">based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills .</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="72" relname="span">With these in hand , we will design the curriculum of clinics ,</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="33" relname="elaboration">based on the method of ' constructive alignment ' ( Biggs et al. , 2011 ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="72" relname="purpose">to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching / learning activities stay aligned .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="53" relname="span">Our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics , each one full day .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="52" relname="sequence">Each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers , that address the conceptual knowledge needed .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="52" relname="sequence">The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills , following the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="74" relname="span">By having researchers provide the lecture sessions ,</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="39" relname="purpose">we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="76" relname="span">With these clinics , we hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities ,</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="purpose">making access to support easier for new digital scholars .</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="73" relname="joint">The poster at DH2017 will present the curriculum , its position in the international context and offer the lessons learned from both the design process and the first clinics .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="73" relname="joint">We welcome discussion about our efforts and the possibilities of applying this in other contexts .</segment>
