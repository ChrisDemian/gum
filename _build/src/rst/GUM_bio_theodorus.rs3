		<segment id="13" parent="80" relname="span">Theodorus opted to follow the visiting monk ,</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="evaluation">and his persistence ( and lack of obedience ) paid off .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="86" relname="sequence">He was welcomed by Pachomius upon his arrival , and quickly integrated into the community at Tabennese around 328 .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="17" relname="circumstance">Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius ,</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="90" relname="span">Theodorus lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery , and took on the title of the " brothers ’ comforter " .</segment>

		<segment id="21" parent="20" relname="concession">despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="94" relname="sequence">Finally , Pachomius called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth ,</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="95" relname="span">and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese</segment>

		<segment id="29" parent="30" relname="cause">Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery ,</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="99" relname="span">Theodorus became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="99" relname="elaboration">Despite his clear potential and popularity , Pachomius refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority ;</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="70" relname="preparation">though the old man 's failing health soon changed things forever .</segment>

		<segment id="35" parent="100" relname="span">Pachomius became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="103" relname="background">Pachomius had not named a successor ,</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="102" relname="span">and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia</segment>

		<segment id="41" parent="42" relname="cause">and upon hearing of Theodorus ’ decision ,</segment>

		<segment id="47" parent="108" relname="joint">In 348 Pachomius died ,</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="108" relname="joint">naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus .</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="109" relname="joint">The death of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge ,</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="109" relname="joint">and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum .</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="52" relname="concession">Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia ,</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="110" relname="span">problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader .</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="111" relname="joint">Refusing to work or communicate</segment>

		<segment id="55" parent="112" relname="span">many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios .</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="115" relname="elaboration">The federation of monasteries was falling apart ,</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="113" relname="span">and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese</segment>

		<segment id="59" parent="117" relname="span">Soon after his arrival , Theodorus was the new de facto leader ,</segment>
