<body>Method 2 of 2 : Using Grammar Name your language . This is the most fundamental property in all languages . You have many names to choose from . You can even use a made up word from your made up language like &apos; Victory &apos; or &apos; Great Language &apos; . The choice is all yours . Start off with the highly frequently used words such as &apos; and &apos; or &apos; I &apos; or &apos; one &apos; or &apos; the &apos; . It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used . An example would be &apos; ant &apos; for and or &apos; es &apos; or even &apos; loo &apos; for the word &apos; and &apos; . Start thinking about the grammar rules . For example if the word Bird is &apos; Vogelaviatiolap &apos; then why not make the word Birds &apos; Vogelaviatiolaps &apos; since the suffix &apos; s &apos; is added at the end for most languages at plurals . If you want to add complication , you can add genders like most European languages like French and German . For example , if you want the word &apos; horse &apos; to be a boy , you may want &apos; the horse &apos; to be &apos; Mat Fereder &apos; , but a &apos; cat &apos; to be a girl , you may want , &apos; the cat &apos; to be &apos; Fet Kamaow &apos; . Consider basing your language on an existing language . For example , in my made up language , &apos; Vogelaviatiolap &apos; means Bird . If you have n&apos;t guessed , it comes from the following : &apos; Vogel &apos; comes from German , which means bird &apos; aviatio &apos; comes from English . It &apos;s uncompleted though , because the word is part of the term &apos; aviation &apos; &apos; lap &apos; comes from Onomatopoeia . It &apos;s a completed term , but it is supposed to come from &apos; Flap ! &apos; Consider basing some of your words from other words you have invented . For example , if you invented the word &apos; China &apos; as &apos; Khinssa &apos; , &apos; Drink &apos; as &apos; Bever &apos; , and the word &apos; Accident &apos; as &apos; Casnondelibreaten &apos; , why not make the word &apos; tea &apos; as &apos; Khincasnonbever &apos; or &apos; Bevernondelibreatekin &apos; or even &apos; Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever &apos; ! Get inspiration from existing alphabets and words . Why not add some non Latin Characters such as &#223; ? You can even make the whole language not based on the Latin Alphabet at all like Chinese ! You can even take some words of languages , altering them or not . You can make the word &apos; pen &apos; as &apos; penn &apos; or even &apos; pen &apos; . Using the dictionary can ensure you not missing a single word . Keep track of all your Remember to write down your creations ! Use your language . Get used to using it yourself , and spread it to others . Once you feel confident about your language , experiment and expand : Grab a book / novel and translate it to your own language . Teach your friends this new language . As soon as your friends understand your language , communicate to them with it . Be fluent in your own made up language and start spreading this to your friends , family and strangers ! Write your own poem / novel / story with your own made up language . If you &apos;re really ambitious , set a goal of helping others become fluent in the language . One day , maybe you can make it the official language of a country ! Tips Make sure that it is a language that while speaking , you do n&apos;t get a literal knot in your tongue ! Remember you should know how to write it . For example we write it from left to right , in Arabic it &apos;s right to left , Chinese is in columns , and so on . Make sure that you and your friend(s) all follow a systematic language system . In other words , make sure that you follow the same guidelines . Do n&apos;t use random letters . It should make some sense , so that it will be easier to learn and speak with [ Example : Do n&apos;t use oh as e , hello as llo , and See ya as c yah ) . Make sure you practice saying and spelling out many basic words in your language , English examples : is , who , when , of , why , if , what , where , can , may , etc . When starting off , follow closely to a language you like . This will make grammar much easier to make . You must avoid simply copying the grammar rules , however , as this would technically turn your language into a code . Practice your language frequently so that you do n&apos;t forget it ! Do n&apos;t forget punctuation ! As a shortcut , and for a bit of interesting background , add connotation to various letters , preferably vowels . To do this , think of various words that begin with / have a lot of a certain vowel . For example : austere , acrimony , ebullient , embolden ; in this case , the vowel A might carry with it a negative meaning , whereas E would be positive . Then , even if you forget your own words without the help of your dictionary , you could still make a good guess based on the composition of the letters . Try not to make your words sound like utter and complete gibberish just add a little extra than our regular English language . We do n&apos;t want a knot in your tongue after speaking to your friends . Just put marks over the letters or make up something right on the spot , you might have to take some time on this ! Basing letters on objects ( pictographs ) is an easy way to start a writing system . Try this with a group of friends . It &apos;s much more fun when there are other people that can understand your language . Email or text your friends the language so that they wo n&apos;t be so confused . When making a writing system , take a break about every five minutes and come back to it or all your letters will begin to look identical . If you want to make other languages , you can use this language as a model and change some letters or sounds to create a different language . This makes your first language a proto-language â€” a language that branches off into a family of languages . </body>
