<body>How to Detect Arrogant People Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves , intolerant of people different from them , rude or downright arrogant ? These people can be a great source of potential pain , and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant . Steps Pay attention to their conversations . Do n&apos;t eavesdrop , but when they &apos;re talking to you or to those around you , listen to them . Is it always about them ? Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else ? These are good signs of arrogance . Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience , and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience &quot; have got something over them &quot; . Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning ( actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability ) , arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited , narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others . Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you do n&apos;t . Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good . When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you . This happens when you question ( or at least seem to question ) their appearance , intelligence , athletic abilities , or anything else relating to their self-image . Challenge their worldview . Do n&apos;t be aggressive –– just skeptical and curious . If they get upset , gauge their anger . If it &apos;s minimal , they may be simply having a bad day . But if they &apos;re enraged , then they may see you as questioning their &apos; perfect little world . &apos; And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance . At some point or another , most people realize that the world does n&apos;t revolve around them . Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them , and get angry if they &apos;re reminded of the real world . Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection , change and lack of certainty ( realities we all must contend with as best we can ) . As such , instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one &apos;s preferences , the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone , which of course , is an impossible mission . Reality hurts when it intrudes ; as such , an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse , thereby not seeing their own imperfections . They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances . Learn the quality of their friendships . Do n&apos;t be nosy or gossipy , but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next , that &apos;s a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends . That &apos;s a sign of arrogance , since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who &apos;s stuck on themselves . Prideful people have a strong need to look good , and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that . Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them , they often ca n&apos;t stand the thought of a good friendship . Ironically , arrogant people often ca n&apos;t understand why they do n&apos;t have any reliable and supportive friends . How do they treat those not like themselves ? In other words , how do they treat those with different beliefs , cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world ? If it &apos;s inherently negative , then they &apos;re either over-zealous , ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only . Determine this based on their general personality and the people they &apos;re interacting with . Many times prideful people have a serious &apos; my-way&apos;s-the-only-way &apos; attitude . This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land . What &apos;s their personality like ? Take note of how they act , talk , and use their social status . Do they have a general sense of &apos; coolness ? &apos; Are they a chatterbox ? Do they act like they own the place , or act like the &apos; big dog ? &apos; Are they very keen on their self-image ? Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through . But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they do n&apos;t like . When they are cruel , their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they &apos;re afraid that they &apos;ll be treated badly by their &apos; friend . &apos; Mention people you know that they do n&apos;t like . This is n&apos;t meant to begin a conflict , but to gauge their rivalries , annoyances and enmities . If their condemnation seems to be reasonable , they probably are n&apos;t hubristic . If it &apos;s harsh , they are . For the most part , arrogant people see people that they do n&apos;t like as threats to their perfect little world . The more they hate someone , the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land . And in turn , the bigger the threat , the harsher the criticism . Ask around to see what they &apos;ve been saying about you . If they have been saying bad things about you , they may simply not like you . If they &apos;re nice to your face , but talk bad about you behind your back like it &apos;s their favourite hobby , then they probably have a problem with pride . Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they do n&apos;t have any good friends . They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends - they have a &apos; quantity , not quality &apos; mentality . Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they are n&apos;t looking . </body>
