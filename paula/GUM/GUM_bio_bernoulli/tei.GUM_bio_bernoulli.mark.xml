		<!--Taking his discoveries further , Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy . It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height . Daniel realised that in a similar way , a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure . Mathematically this law is now written : ½ ρ u 2 + P = constant where P is pressure , ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity . A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls . This is exploited by the wing of an aeroplane which is designed to create an area above its surface where the air velocity increases . The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing , so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing .-->
