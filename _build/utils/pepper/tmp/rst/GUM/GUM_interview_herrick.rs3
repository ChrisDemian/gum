    <segment id="4" parent="93" relname="span">wikiHow is a wiki-based site which aims to " build the world 's largest , highest quality how-to manual . "</segment>
    <segment id="73" parent="4" relname="elaboration">It recently published its 50,000th article ,</segment>
    <segment id="90" parent="74" relname="purpose">and to discuss what the site has achieved since its creation ,</segment>
    <segment id="74" parent="91" relname="span">Wikinews interviewed the site 's founder , Jack Herrick .</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="103" relname="span">In the interview , Herrick explains what wikiHow is , why he decided to create it , how he grew it in size , and why he chose to use a Creative Commons license ( HyperLink ) for his site .</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration">Read below for more of the interview in full .</segment>
    <segment id="76" parent="96" relname="preparation">Interview</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="92" relname="solutionhood">For our readers who are unaware of your site , could you briefly explain what wikiHow is ?</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="preparation">Sure .</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="92" relname="span">wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world 's largest , highest quality how-to manual .</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="104" relname="span">Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language .</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="77" relname="concession">We 're quite far from our goals currently ,</segment>
    <segment id="77" parent="95" relname="span">but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="77" relname="evidence">We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles .</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="94" relname="span">We hope that in time , we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status .</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="97" relname="span">That said , we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve .</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="98" relname="span">However , in terms of readership , we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia .</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="99" relname="span">We get over 14 million unique visitors per month ( source : Google Analytics ) , which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast .</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="elaboration">[ Note : The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met ]</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="19" relname="background">Like Wikipedia , wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software .</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="106" relname="contrast">Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world .</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="107" relname="span">That said , we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects :</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="105" relname="span">We are much smaller .</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="21" relname="evidence">The English wikiHow has only 60 admins , compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia .</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="109" relname="span">As a result , wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors .</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="110" relname="span">We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good .</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="112" relname="span">This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation .</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="111" relname="span">We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors</segment>
    <segment id="79" parent="26" relname="antithesis">rather than ask for donations .</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="113" relname="span">Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons .</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="27" relname="elaboration">( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity ) .</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="114" relname="span">In addition , we 've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral .</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="29" relname="elaboration">( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral ) Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility .</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="112" relname="result">As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online .</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="117" relname="solutionhood">Why did you decide to create wikiHow ?</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="120" relname="span">I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person .</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="35" relname="preparation">Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine .</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="116" relname="span">How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity ?</segment>
    <segment id="75" parent="121" relname="span">I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world .</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="72" relname="justify">Knowledge is power</segment>
    <segment id="72" parent="122" relname="span">and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful .</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="138" relname="joint">I 've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow .</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="123" relname="span">My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow .</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="38" relname="elaboration">eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world .</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="139" relname="span">eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software .</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="127" relname="circumstance">When I ran eHow ,</segment>
    <segment id="127" parent="137" relname="span">the content was professionally produced and edited .</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="128" relname="contrast">This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets .</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="132" relname="span">However , paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices .</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="130" relname="contrast">You either 1 ) sacrifice on breadth and do n't produce the topics that wo n't interest advertisers ,</segment>
    <segment id="80" parent="130" relname="contrast">or 2 ) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n't cost much to write .</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="134" relname="span">I was n't interested in making either of these sacrifices ,</segment>
    <segment id="81" parent="45" relname="justify">as I think the world 's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive .</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="128" relname="result">So ultimately I decided that eHow 's model would not build the resource I envisioned .</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="135" relname="circumstance">When I discovered Wikipedia ,</segment>
    <segment id="135" parent="136" relname="span">I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs .</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="135" relname="result">So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow .</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="141" relname="solutionhood">Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license ?</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="141" relname="span">We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork</segment>
    <segment id="156" parent="50" relname="elaboration">( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork ) .</segment>
    <segment id="51" parent="143" relname="span">In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave . "</segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="82" relname="condition">If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction ,</segment>
    <segment id="82" parent="142" relname="span">they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere .</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="82" relname="justify">This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license .</segment>
    <segment id="54" parent="145" relname="span">This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community .</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="54" relname="evaluation">I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far .</segment>
    <segment id="56" parent="54" relname="evaluation">My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others .</segment>
    <segment id="57" parent="148" relname="span">That said , when we started out I did n't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver 's license .</segment>
    <segment id="58" parent="147" relname="span">As a result , we made some mistakes along the path .</segment>
    <segment id="59" parent="149" relname="span">In retrospect , I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC .</segment>
    <segment id="60" parent="59" relname="justify">At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects .</segment>
    <segment id="61" parent="62" relname="background">wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month .</segment>
    <segment id="62" parent="154" relname="span">How did you grow the site to the size it is today ?</segment>
    <segment id="63" parent="159" relname="span">In December 2008 , wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics</segment>
    <segment id="157" parent="63" relname="evidence">( Full data : http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics ) .</segment>
    <segment id="64" parent="155" relname="span">Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US .</segment>
    <segment id="65" parent="64" relname="evidence">( http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com ) .</segment>
    <segment id="66" parent="158" relname="preparation">wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons .</segment>
    <segment id="67" parent="158" relname="joint">First , people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information .</segment>
    <segment id="68" parent="67" relname="justify">People want to learn more practical skills , and for the most part the internet does n't provide enough quality information yet .</segment>
    <segment id="69" parent="158" relname="joint">Second , we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing :</segment>
    <segment id="83" parent="84" relname="concession">We had some articles of mixed quality ,</segment>
    <segment id="84" parent="160" relname="span">and editors joined to improve those articles ,</segment>
    <segment id="85" parent="161" relname="span">which in turn attracted more readers .</segment>
    <segment id="70" parent="126" relname="preparation">We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle :</segment>
    <segment id="86" parent="87" relname="cause">More readers ,</segment>
    <segment id="87" parent="124" relname="span">means more editors ,</segment>
    <segment id="88" parent="125" relname="span">which creates better instructions ,</segment>
    <segment id="89" parent="126" relname="span">leading again to more readers .</segment>
    <segment id="71" parent="126" relname="evaluation">It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed .</segment>
