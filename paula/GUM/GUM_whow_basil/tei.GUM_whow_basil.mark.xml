Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow , but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained . 2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost . Basil needs warm air and sun to do well , so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost . If you live in a hot climate , you can start the seeds outside instead . To figure out when the last frost will be , consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area . 3 Prepare seed containers . Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat . Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets . Dampen the mixture with water so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate . 4 Plant the seeds . Drop one to two seeds into each container . Cover them lightly with soil . Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap , so they stay moist . Leave the containers in a sunny window . Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water . 5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge . When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil , it 's time to remove the plastic wrap . Keep watering the sprouts twice daily , never letting the soil dry out . When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature , it 's time to transplant them to a larger container .-->

		<!--1 Transplant the basil plants . Once two sets of leaves have formed , basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers . Basil does not tolerate frost so do n't plant too early . It 's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil . To plant the basil in the garden , dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart . Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems . Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets . If you want to plant the basil in a container , make sure it 's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you 're growing ; they need to be planted 6 inches apart , since they grow quite large . 2 Keep the soil damp , but not soaked . Basil does best in well-drained soil , and should not be subjected to standing water . Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning , so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight . 3 Pinch off flower heads . When you see flower buds , pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off . Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves , as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows . This is called " bolting " and is more likely to happen when there 's extra sunshine . You 'll notice that if you leave the flowers , the plant will become lanky and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty . 4 Watch for pests and mold . Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand . If your plants show signs of mold growth , they may not be getting adequate sunlight , or they may be too close together . Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space .-->

Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese . 3 Store the basil in the refrigerator . You 'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh , so plan on storing some in the fridge . Wash the leaves , dry them well , and wrap them in paper towels . Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid . 4 Freeze the basil . Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well , but if you puree it first you can freeze it for months .
