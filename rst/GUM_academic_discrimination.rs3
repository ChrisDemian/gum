		<segment id="8" parent="72" relname="joint">and evolutionary theorists have explored the various ways that in-group / out-group biases emerged across the history of our species . [ 10 ]</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="122" relname="span">In many respects , researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias . [ 11 ]</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="124" relname="span">What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="75" relname="span">Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members . [ 12 ]</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="124" relname="background">Indeed , the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are , at least to some appreciable amount , present in modern society .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="126" relname="span">Even so , estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="14" relname="evidence">( see [ 13 – 14 ] ) .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="127" relname="span">At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [ 15 ] , however , using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample , reported that approximately 33 % of respondents reported some form of discrimination</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="16" relname="evidence">( see also , Gibbons et al. [ 4 ] ) .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="78" relname="span">The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large , nationally representative sample of adults from the United States .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="18" relname="elaboration">Additionally , the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="87" relname="preparation">Reason for discrimination .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="22" relname="preparation">All respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically , those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question :</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="85" relname="span">“ What do you think was the main reason for these experiences ? ”</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="84" relname="span">Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categories .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="83" relname="span">For the present analysis , these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="24" relname="result">capturing the following options :</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="81" relname="joint">race / ancestry / skin color ;</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="81" relname="joint">gender ;</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="81" relname="joint">age ;</segment>

		<segment id="34" parent="81" relname="joint">other .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="81" relname="elaboration">The following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis : race ; ancestry or national origin ; and shade of skin color .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="37" relname="cause">Additionally , because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences ,</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="82" relname="span">the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing ( legitimate skip ) .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="138" relname="preparation">Respondent race .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="40" relname="cause">Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews ,</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="92" relname="span">we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="93" relname="span">Wave 1 race — rather than , say , Wave 3 race — was used to preserve case counts .</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="134" relname="contrast">The logic is that ( nearly ) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample ,</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="135" relname="span">but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="43" relname="cause">due to differential patterns of temporary attrition .</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="136" relname="preparation">Respondents were asked to indicate their race from among the following categories :</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="136" relname="span">White ; Black or African American ; Hispanic ; American Indian or Native American ; and Asian or Pacific Islander .</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="137" relname="span">Respondents were provided the opportunity to select more than one race ,</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="98" relname="joint">and those who did were asked a follow-up question regarding which category best described their racial background .</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="98" relname="joint">In the current study , those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as “ mixed race ” .</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="104" relname="preparation">Demographic variables .</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="52" relname="purpose">To provide information on the analytical sample as a whole ,</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="102" relname="span">two additional demographic variables are included .</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="103" relname="joint">First , age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents ' birth ( obtained from Wave 1 ) from the year of the interview at Wave 4 .</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="103" relname="joint">Second , sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 ( 0 = female and 1 = male ) .</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="118" relname="preparation">Analytical plan .</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="106" relname="preparation">Our exploratory study included three basic steps .</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="106" relname="sequence">First , summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="106" relname="sequence">Second , we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category .</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="106" relname="sequence">Finally , we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories .</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="107" relname="purpose">In order to examine potential bivariate associations ,</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="107" relname="span">the adjusted F statistic ( design-based F ) was employed</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="61" relname="cause">as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health . [ 21 ]</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="64" relname="circumstance">More specifically , when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="109" relname="span">the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “ an F statistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott ( 1981 [ 22 ] , 1984 [ 23 ] ) correction ” . [ 24 ]</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="110" relname="span">The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic )</segment>
		<segment id="66" parent="65" relname="cause">given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data .</segment>
		<segment id="67" parent="140" relname="span">This final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination .</segment>
		<segment id="68" parent="112" relname="joint">As noted earlier , all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff</segment>
		<segment id="69" parent="112" relname="joint">and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategy .</segment>
		<segment id="70" parent="141" relname="span">Thus , all estimates reported here can be considered nationally representative of the United States .</segment>
