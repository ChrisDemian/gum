		<segment id="2" parent="70" relname="circumstance">Thursday , February 23 , 2006</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="53" relname="span">Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient , researchers say .</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="53" relname="evaluation">The report 's authors say iodine deficiency is " the sleeper health issue in Australia " , and potentially a very serious one .</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="54" relname="restatement">The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week , revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="56" relname="span">The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="7" relname="background">They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="59" relname="span">A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8 – 10 years , from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia and Queensland , between July 2003 and December 2004 .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="58" relname="span">Tasmania was excluded from the study -</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="10" relname="cause">where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread , is ongoing .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="13" relname="justify">The authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="61" relname="span">They call for " urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia . "</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="62" relname="background">Most iodine in food comes from seafood , milk and iodised salt .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="78" relname="span">Professor Cres Eastman , Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study , and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders , says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="justify">Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage , stunted growth and deafness .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="79" relname="contrast">Professor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="79" relname="contrast">" I suspect they wo n't do that on a voluntary basis , we 've tried so far and have n't succeeded , so we 've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand | that all salt should be iodised , " he said .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="66" relname="span">The report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry , where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="19" relname="justify">Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades , but is now declining .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="67" relname="span">Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="evidence">The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="24" relname="background">Professor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="71" relname="span">He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="26" relname="background">" The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="80" relname="span">So if we go to the pregnant woman , she does n't get enough iodine , she wo n't make enough thyroid hormone , and the foetus wo n't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain , so you 'll then see consequences being loss of IQ , learning difficulties , hearing difficulties and other neurological problems , " Professor Eastman said .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="74" relname="condition">" If an infant 's not getting enough iodine ...</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="72" relname="joint">brain development wo n't be completed</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="72" relname="joint">and they wo n't grow normally ,</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="73" relname="circumstance">and as you get older</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="73" relname="joint">the problem will be that you will develop a goiter</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="73" relname="joint">and your thyroid wo n't function as well as it should ,</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="76" relname="result">so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life . "</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="81" relname="contrast">More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency ,</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="81" relname="contrast">and yet the problem is easily fixed .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="84" relname="span">The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="83" relname="joint">The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism , a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="83" relname="joint">WHO say Iodine deficiency is the world ’s most prevalent , yet easily preventable , cause of brain damage .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="87" relname="evaluation">Professor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found .</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="94" relname="span">" Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="40" relname="evaluation">So that alarms me , because there 's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country , " he said .</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="43" relname="condition">" If Iodine deficiency is serious</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="86" relname="span">you lose 15 IQ points , on average .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="88" relname="span">There should n't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia . "</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="89" relname="span">Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand , says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="45" relname="concession">She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right .</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="63" relname="contrast">We need to " make sure there 's sufficient iodine added into the food supply , to help those people with a deficiency .</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="63" relname="contrast">But at the other end of the scale we 've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people do n't get too much and get overdose , " Ms Bauchtman said .</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="63" relname="elaboration">" One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking . "</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="64" relname="preparation">Senior researcher Mu Li , of the University of NSW 's school of public health , said</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="64" relname="span">" it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient ,</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="51" relname="result">putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency . "</segment>
