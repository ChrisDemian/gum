		<!--Pack one room at a time if possible , and start with items that are least often used . Write down a list of everything you are packing , in particular if it 's valuable .

That way , you can easily stack boxes on top of one another . Tape the bottom of the box securely so that it does n't give way . Never fill a box until it is so heavy that you ca n't lift it safely . Spread the heavy items over a few boxes . Balance boxes with lighter items like towels or soft toys . Pack the lighter items on top . Use bubble wrap or newspapers when packing fragile items . However , newsprint may smudge so use newspaper selectively . Clean paper can be purchased cheaply from moving supply stores . Mark boxes . Boxes should be marked " Fragile " and " This side up " to prevent mishandling . Label each box clearly and which room it belongs to . Write on the sides of the box as well . Pack a separate box of essentials you may need for the first night at your new house . Include items like toiletries , toilet paper , bottled water , snacks and a change of clothes in case you can not unpack everything in time .-->

Instead of writing " Silver Service - Fragile " you should write something that makes it sound less theft inviting while showing the fragile nature of the contents . Example : " Mom 's old dishes " instead of " Fine China " Tape is cheap . Use lots of it . Close box bottoms well . Get masking tape or packing tape and tape screws and other little things that came out of something back against it . You 'll want to find the right screw reassemble something without having to pick it out of 100 others when you get there . Do n't pack one box full of books or paperwork - you might not be able to carry it at all . Fill it halfway with books , and fill it up with lighter stuff . National superstores ( Walmart ) will let you walk the store for boxes when they are stocking the stores between 11 pm and 1 am . You can find boxes of all sizes . Cereal , diaper and houseware boxes are a good size and durable . Just take a cart and roam the store . They do check the cart as you leave so do n't try to sneak anything past them . U-haul and other nation companies offer box buy back services . If you buy too many boxes you can return the unused for a full refund . These boxes are also quite sturdy so you can re-use them or stash in your attic until you move again . Some national companies even offer free shipping and handling so you can have some delivered or go to the local location . Fill empty spaces with additional paper . Throw away or donate junk you do n't want to take to your new place . Do n't pack it again ! ! ! Set aside an area of the house where you can put all the packed boxes . Use a room that is n't used every day such as the formal dining or living room . You wo n't be tripping over boxes and you can have a better idea of what you have and where things are . Pack books and heavy items into smaller boxes . Digital Photos - use your camera to document the contents of boxes .-->
