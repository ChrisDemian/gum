		<segment id="1" parent="53" relname="preparation">Introduction</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="59" relname="background">Research on adult-learned second language ( L2 ) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [ 1 ] – [ 11 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="63" relname="span">Of interest here , studies suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="evaluation">However , it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="58" relname="span">Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 .</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="33" relname="span">In fact , substantial periods ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="6" relname="evidence">Such a scenario may be found in different situations , including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [ 19 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="36" relname="span">In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar :</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="34" relname="contrast">that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native-like neural processes ( “ use it or lose it ” [ 20 ] ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="34" relname="contrast">no such changes ,</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="34" relname="contrast">or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native-like processing may be observed .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="35" relname="joint">Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="52" relname="preparation">Previous Research</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="39" relname="span">We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="38" relname="span">( Note that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on L2s acquired by children ;</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="solutionhood">for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="41" relname="span">The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="40" relname="contrast">These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [ 21 ] ,</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="40" relname="contrast">with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [ 24 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="42" relname="span">Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] or mixed classroom and immersion training [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="20" relname="elaboration">The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years , and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels ( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] ) prior to the period of limited exposure .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="48" relname="preparation">Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="46" relname="span">A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="43" relname="contrast">Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] ,</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="43" relname="contrast">though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier [ 17 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="44" relname="concession">Although attrition may take place within the first few years ,</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="44" relname="span">some studies suggest that it then appears to level off ,</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="27" relname="restatement">with no further losses occurring [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="47" relname="elaboration">Higher levels of proficiency ( or exposure ) may be associated with less attrition [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] or even with no observed losses [ 21 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="48" relname="contrast">Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [ 22 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="50" relname="span">Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="31" relname="concession">It remains unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] .</segment>
