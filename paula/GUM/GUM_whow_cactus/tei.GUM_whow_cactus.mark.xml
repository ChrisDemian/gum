		<!--Purchase Beavertail cactus seeds . These can be bought at garden centers or purchased online . Scatter the seeds . In a shady garden bed , simply scatter the seeds on the soil . There 's no need to cover them , unless you want to use netting to keep the birds off . Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate . Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade . Beavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow , whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight . Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting . It can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers . Method 2 of 2 : From Cuttings Obtain Beavertail cuttings . You can purchase them online or at a local garden center . If you already own a Beavertail cactus , you can make your own cuttings . To do this , choose pads ( the flat , oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus ) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the base . In order to form a callous and prevent rot , cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry , dark place for 10 to 14 days . Plant the cuttings . Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it . Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage . Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch ( 2.5 cm. ) deep . If you plant the cuttings too deep , they might rot . Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place . Choose a spot for your Beavertail cactus cuttings . If you live in an area with strong summer sun , position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south . This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day . Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds . Wait for a month . Do not water the cutting for the first month . The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow . Too much water might cause rot . After 1 month , roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time . Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings . Once fully rooted , they are extremely drought resistant . Fertilize the plants . During the spring , summer , and fall , the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer . Let the cuttings grow . From the first pad , many more will form . The second or third pad will bear some flowers , but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests .-->

In order to form a callous and prevent rot , cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry , dark place for 10 to 14 days . Plant the cuttings . Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it . Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage . Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch ( 2.5 cm. ) deep . If you plant the cuttings too deep , they might rot . Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place . Choose a spot for your Beavertail cactus cuttings . If you live in an area with strong summer sun , position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south . This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day . Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds . Wait for a month . Do not water the cutting for the first month . The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow . Too much water might cause rot . After 1 month , roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time . Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings . Once fully rooted , they are extremely drought resistant . Fertilize the plants . During the spring , summer , and fall , the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer . Let the cuttings grow . From the first pad , many more will form . The second or third pad will bear some flowers , but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests .-->
