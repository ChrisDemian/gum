    <segment id="1" parent="65" relname="restatement">How to Detect Arrogant People</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="70" relname="span">Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves , intolerant of people different from them , rude or downright arrogant ?</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="evaluation">These people can be a great source of potential pain ,</segment>
    <segment id="61" parent="65" relname="span">and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant .</segment>
    <segment id="60" parent="129" relname="preparation">Steps</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="79" relname="span">Pay attention to their conversations .</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="76" relname="span">Do n't eavesdrop , but when they 're talking to you or to those around you , listen to them .</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="75" relname="span">Is it always about them ?</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="69" relname="span">Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else ?</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="68" relname="span">These are good signs of arrogance .</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="72" relname="span">Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience , and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience " have got something over them " .</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="elaboration">Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning ( actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability ) , arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited , narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others .</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="72" relname="elaboration">Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you do n't .</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="67" relname="span">Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good .</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="63" relname="span">When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you .</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">This happens when you question ( or at least seem to question ) their appearance , intelligence , athletic abilities , or anything else relating to their self-image .</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="151" relname="span">Challenge their worldview .</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="concession">Do n't be aggressive –– just skeptical and curious .</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="74" relname="condition">If they get upset ,</segment>
    <segment id="74" parent="80" relname="span">gauge their anger .</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="81" relname="condition">If it 's minimal ,</segment>
    <segment id="81" parent="85" relname="span">they may be simply having a bad day .</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="82" relname="condition">But if they 're enraged ,</segment>
    <segment id="82" parent="84" relname="span">then they may see you as questioning their ' perfect little world . '</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="87" relname="span">And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance .</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="antithesis">At some point or another , most people realize that the world does n't revolve around them .</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="88" relname="span">Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them , and get angry if they 're reminded of the real world .</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="94" relname="span">Ambiguity frightens arrogant people</segment>
    <segment id="90" parent="23" relname="cause">because it suggests imperfection , change and lack of certainty ( realities we all must contend with as best we can ) .</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="91" relname="antithesis">As such , instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one 's preferences ,</segment>
    <segment id="91" parent="93" relname="span">the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone , which of course , is an impossible mission .</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="92" relname="cause">Reality hurts when it intrudes ;</segment>
    <segment id="92" parent="96" relname="span">as such , an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse , thereby not seeing their own imperfections .</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="98" relname="span">They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements</segment>
    <segment id="97" parent="26" relname="antithesis">instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances .</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="147" relname="preparation">Learn the quality of their friendships .</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="99" relname="antithesis">Do n't be nosy or gossipy ,</segment>
    <segment id="99" parent="102" relname="span">but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next ,</segment>
    <segment id="100" parent="147" relname="span">that 's a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends .</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="103" relname="span">That 's a sign of arrogance ,</segment>
    <segment id="101" parent="29" relname="justify">since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who 's stuck on themselves .</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="149" relname="span">Prideful people have a strong need to look good , and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that .</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="104" relname="cause">Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them ,</segment>
    <segment id="104" parent="105" relname="span">they often ca n't stand the thought of a good friendship .</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="104" relname="elaboration">Ironically , arrogant people often ca n't understand why they do n't have any reliable and supportive friends .</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="108" relname="span">How do they treat those not like themselves ?</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="33" relname="restatement">In other words , how do they treat those with different beliefs , cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world ?</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="106" relname="condition">If it 's inherently negative ,</segment>
    <segment id="106" parent="107" relname="span">then they 're either over-zealous , ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only .</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="107" relname="solutionhood">Determine this based on their general personality and the people they 're interacting with .</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="109" relname="span">Many times prideful people have a serious ' my-way's-the-only-way ' attitude .</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="37" relname="evaluation">This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land .</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="40" relname="solutionhood">What 's their personality like ?</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="110" relname="span">Take note of how they act , talk , and use their social status .</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="40" relname="solutionhood">Do they have a general sense of ' coolness ? '</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="40" relname="solutionhood">Are they a chatterbox ?</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="40" relname="solutionhood">Do they act like they own the place , or act like the ' big dog ? '</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="40" relname="solutionhood">Are they very keen on their self-image ?</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="111" relname="contrast">Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through .</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="115" relname="span">But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they do n't like .</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="112" relname="circumstance">When they are cruel ,</segment>
    <segment id="112" parent="114" relname="span">their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it</segment>
    <segment id="113" parent="112" relname="cause">since they 're afraid that they 'll be treated badly by their ' friend . '</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="131" relname="span">Mention people you know that they do n't like .</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="116" relname="antithesis">This is n't meant to begin a conflict ,</segment>
    <segment id="116" parent="117" relname="span">but to gauge their rivalries , annoyances and enmities .</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="118" relname="condition">If their condemnation seems to be reasonable ,</segment>
    <segment id="118" parent="122" relname="span">they probably are n't hubristic .</segment>
    <segment id="51" parent="119" relname="condition">If it 's harsh ,</segment>
    <segment id="119" parent="121" relname="span">they are .</segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="130" relname="span">For the most part , arrogant people see people that they do n't like as threats to their perfect little world .</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="124" relname="circumstance">The more they hate someone ,</segment>
    <segment id="124" parent="126" relname="span">the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land .</segment>
    <segment id="62" parent="125" relname="circumstance">And in turn , the bigger the threat ,</segment>
    <segment id="125" parent="127" relname="span">the harsher the criticism .</segment>
    <segment id="54" parent="145" relname="span">Ask around to see what they 've been saying about you .</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="132" relname="condition">If they have been saying bad things about you ,</segment>
    <segment id="132" parent="139" relname="contrast">they may simply not like you .</segment>
    <segment id="56" parent="137" relname="contrast">If they 're nice to your face ,</segment>
    <segment id="133" parent="137" relname="contrast">but talk bad about you behind your back like it 's their favourite hobby ,</segment>
    <segment id="134" parent="140" relname="span">then they probably have a problem with pride .</segment>
    <segment id="57" parent="58" relname="cause">Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they do n't have any good friends .</segment>
    <segment id="58" parent="141" relname="contrast">They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends -</segment>
    <segment id="135" parent="58" relname="restatement">they have a ' quantity , not quality ' mentality .</segment>
    <segment id="59" parent="142" relname="span">Then they simply insult their trophy friends</segment>
    <segment id="136" parent="59" relname="circumstance">when they are n't looking .</segment>
