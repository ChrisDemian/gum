Two thirds of the way through the cycle , shake all bottles vigorously . Once the cycle has finished , shake all bottles vigorously again . Then place in the freezer for 2 hours . Once the vodka is cold , it should be syrupy . Take a sieve , line it with a piece of cheesecloth ( muslin ) or a coffee filter , place above a large jug and pour the vodka through slowly . Once the first bottle has been filtered , wash out the bottle and pour the Skittles vodka back in . Repeat the above two steps for all bottles , ensuring that everything is cleaned between uses to prevent color contamination . Place all of the bottles in the freezer until you are ready to drink . Do n't worry , the vodka wo n't freeze . You are finished . Enjoy your tasty creation .-->

		<!--If you want to make it more quickly , cut the skittles in half before putting them into vodka . Shake every 15 minutes . They 'll dissolve in an hour instead of a day . Or you could just scoop them out when the color dissolves . Start with small amount of vodka and Skittles at first to experiment which combination of taste suits you best . You can carry this out with larger amount of vodka and Skittles once you have decided that you enjoy the taste . The lime green Skittles add a sourness to the drink , so if you want one that 's sweet , leave the green ones out and add them to their own bottle for a sour lime vodka . Another approach is to buy five bottles of vodka and five bags of Skittles . Then separate the candy and use one flavor for each bottle . ( Or get four bottles and an empty , to allow room for the skittles . ) If using a t-shirt to strain , be sure fabric softener or a dryer sheet had not been used with it , lets you get some extra ( unwanted ) flavoring ( and potentially toxic chemicals ) .-->
