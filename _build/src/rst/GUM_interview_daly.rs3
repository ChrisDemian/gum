		<segment id="1" parent="86" relname="span">Cold as ice : Wikinews interviews Marymegan Daly on unusual new sea anemone</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="1" relname="circumstance">Tuesday , January 21 , 2014</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="4" relname="solutionhood">How did you come to be involved with this discovery</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="81" relname="span">Frank Rack got in touch after they returned from Antarctica in hopes that I could help with an identification on the anemone .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="134" relname="solutionhood">What was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea ?</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="134" relname="span">I was amazed and really excited .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="82" relname="span">I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate ,</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="84" relname="span">because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="10" relname="result">The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="83" relname="span">because , given our lack of data , we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like , or what it should n't be like .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="12" relname="background">There 's a return trip planned hopefully for 2015 , with both biologists and ANDRILL geologists .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="85" relname="span">Are you intending to go there yourself ?</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="136" relname="concession">I would love to .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="136" relname="span">But I am also happy to not go ,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="14" relname="condition">as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf !</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="17" relname="background">What I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways ,</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="89" relname="span">but it does n't require me to be there .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="19" relname="concession">Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live , and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones ,</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="92" relname="span">ship time is expensive , especially in Antarctica ,</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="21" relname="condition">and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there ,</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="91" relname="span">they should have priority to be there .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="23" relname="preparation">These animals are shrouded in mystery .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="94" relname="span">Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical ;</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="95" relname="span">do they produce some kind of antifreeze , and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own ?</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="126" relname="solutionhood">Talk us through the difficulties encountered when trying to find answers with the specimens on hand .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="126" relname="span">The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin ( a kind of formaldehyde solution ) .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="96" relname="contrast">The formalin is great for preserving structures ,</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="100" relname="span">but for anemones , it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="28" relname="result">This means we ca n't look at the issue you raise with these animals .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="102" relname="span">What we could do , however , was to study anatomy and figure out what it is ,</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="32" relname="condition">so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g. , the genome , transcriptome , or metabolome , or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves ,</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="101" relname="span">we can make precise comparisons , and figure out what these animals have or do ( metabolically or chemically ) that lets them live where they live .</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="103" relname="justify">Just knowing a whole lot about a single species is n't very useful ,</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="35" relname="concession">even if that animal is as special as these clearly are -</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="127" relname="span">we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="127" relname="elaboration">The only way to get at what 's different is to make comparisons with close relatives .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="104" relname="purpose">We can start that side of the work now , anticipating having more beasts in the future .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="106" relname="span">In terms of their glow , I suspect that it 's not theirs -</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="40" relname="concession">although luminescence is common in anemone relatives ,</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="105" relname="span">they do n't usually make light themselves .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="128" relname="span">They do make a host of florescent proteins ,</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="elaboration">and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow .</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="107" relname="solutionhood">What analysis did you perform on the specimens and what equipment was used ?</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="107" relname="sequence">I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal 's external anatomy and overall body organization ( magnification of 60 X ) .</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="107" relname="sequence">I embedded a few of the animals in wax</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="107" relname="sequence">and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome ,</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="107" relname="sequence">mounted the slices on microscope slides ,</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="129" relname="span">stained the slices</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="48" relname="purpose">to enhance contrast ,</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="130" relname="span">and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="50" relname="elaboration">( that 's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper ) .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="131" relname="span">I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="52" relname="purpose">to see the stinging capsules ( = nematocysts ) .</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="109" relname="span">I compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group .</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="56" relname="concession">This step seems trivial ,</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="108" relname="span">but it is really the most important part !</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="109" relname="elaboration">By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found , I figured out what group it belongs to , and was able to determine that within that group , it was a new species .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="59" relname="background">It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication ,</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="114" relname="span">why did it take so long ?</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="118" relname="evaluation">You mean , how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly , right ? :)</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="132" relname="span">It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out .</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="63" relname="evaluation">Some of that time was just lost time -</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="117" relname="span">I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish .</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="119" relname="span">Once we figured out what it was , we played a lot of manuscript email tag ,</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="64" relname="evaluation">which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel , field work , etc.</segment>
		<segment id="66" parent="118" relname="sequence">Manuscript review and processing took about four months .</segment>
		<segment id="67" parent="121" relname="solutionhood">What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used , and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA ?</segment>
		<segment id="68" parent="120" relname="span">The preservation was not unorthodox -</segment>
		<segment id="69" parent="68" relname="evaluation">they followed best practices for anatomical preservation .</segment>
		<segment id="70" parent="121" relname="joint">Having DNA-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes , or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold .</segment>
		<segment id="71" parent="123" relname="preparation">I am curious about the population structure of the " fields " of anemones -</segment>
		<segment id="72" parent="73" relname="background">the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually ,</segment>
		<segment id="73" parent="137" relname="span">and it 's possible that the fields are " clones " produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction .</segment>
		<segment id="74" parent="137" relname="elaboration">DNA is the only way to test this .</segment>
		<segment id="75" parent="139" relname="span">This map shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic , and the two known localities for E. andrillae relative to McMurdo Station</segment>
