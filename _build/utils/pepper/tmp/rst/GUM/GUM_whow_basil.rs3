    <segment id="2" parent="97" relname="span">Three Methods : Starting Seeds Caring for Basil Harvesting and Using Basil</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="77" relname="span">Basil is easy to grow , and transforms ordinary meals into culinary treasures !</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">Fresh basil not only tastes better than dried , it actually tastes different , almost as if it were not the same herb .</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="97" relname="restatement">This article outlines how to plant and harvest basil .</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="102" relname="preparation">Method 1 of 3 : Starting Seeds</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="101" relname="preparation">1 Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow .</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="background">Basil comes in many different varieties , each of which have a unique flavor and smell .</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="96" relname="span">Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you , then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store .</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="98" relname="preparation">Here are a few ideas :</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="98" relname="joint">Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice , and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers .</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="98" relname="joint">Lemon basil actually contains citral , an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit , and smells very lemony .</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="98" relname="joint">Purple basil is often grown for decoration , as well as its scent and flowers .</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="99" relname="span">There are perennial basils which come back year after year , like African Blue Basil ( which has pretty blue veins on its leaves ) and Thai Basil , while most other varieties are annuals ,</segment>
    <segment id="76" parent="14" relname="elaboration">which you 'll have to plant year after year .</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="98" relname="joint">Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow , but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained .</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="107" relname="span">2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost .</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="103" relname="span">Basil needs warm air and sun to do well , so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost .</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="concession">If you live in a hot climate , you can start the seeds outside instead .</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="104" relname="purpose">To figure out when the last frost will be ,</segment>
    <segment id="104" parent="105" relname="span">consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area .</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="90" relname="preparation">3 Prepare seed containers .</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="90" relname="sequence">Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat .</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="90" relname="sequence">Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets .</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="90" relname="sequence">Dampen the mixture with water so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate .</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="91" relname="preparation">4 Plant the seeds .</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="91" relname="sequence">Drop one to two seeds into each container .</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="91" relname="sequence">Cover them lightly with soil .</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="91" relname="sequence">Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap , so they stay moist .</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="91" relname="sequence">Leave the containers in a sunny window .</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="91" relname="sequence">Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water .</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="93" relname="preparation">5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge .</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="92" relname="condition">When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil ,</segment>
    <segment id="92" parent="93" relname="sequence">it 's time to remove the plastic wrap .</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="93" relname="sequence">Keep watering the sprouts twice daily , never letting the soil dry out .</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="93" relname="motivation">When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature , it 's time to transplant them to a larger container .</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="122" relname="preparation">Method 2 of 3 : Caring for Basil</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="110" relname="preparation">1 Transplant the basil plants .</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="86" relname="span">Once two sets of leaves have formed , basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers .</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="36" relname="motivation">Basil does not tolerate frost so do n't plant too early .</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="86" relname="elaboration">It 's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil .</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="111" relname="purpose">To plant the basil in the garden ,</segment>
    <segment id="111" parent="112" relname="span">dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart .</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="94" relname="sequence">Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems .</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="94" relname="sequence">Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets .</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="114" relname="condition">If you want to plant the basil in a container ,</segment>
    <segment id="114" parent="115" relname="span">make sure it 's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you 're growing ;</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="116" relname="span">they need to be planted 6 inches apart ,</segment>
    <segment id="113" parent="43" relname="cause">since they grow quite large .</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="122" relname="sequence">2 Keep the soil damp , but not soaked .</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="89" relname="span">Basil does best in well-drained soil , and should not be subjected to standing water .</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="121" relname="span">Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning ,</segment>
    <segment id="120" parent="46" relname="purpose">so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight .</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="88" relname="preparation">3 Pinch off flower heads .</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="88" relname="span">When you see flower buds , pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off .</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="85" relname="span">Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves , as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows .</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="49" relname="background">This is called " bolting " and is more likely to happen when there 's extra sunshine .</segment>
    <segment id="51" parent="48" relname="motivation">You 'll notice that if you leave the flowers , the plant will become lanky and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty .</segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="128" relname="span">4 Watch for pests and mold .</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="79" relname="span">Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles</segment>
    <segment id="54" parent="53" relname="solutionhood">the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand .</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="80" relname="condition">If your plants show signs of mold growth ,</segment>
    <segment id="80" parent="125" relname="span">they may not be getting adequate sunlight , or they may be too close together .</segment>
    <segment id="56" parent="125" relname="solutionhood">Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space .</segment>
    <segment id="57" parent="133" relname="preparation">Method 3 of 3 : Harvesting and Using Basil</segment>
    <segment id="58" parent="135" relname="span">1 Harvest and prune .</segment>
    <segment id="59" parent="82" relname="span">As the plant matures , pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height .</segment>
    <segment id="60" parent="61" relname="background">If you look closely , at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off .</segment>
    <segment id="61" parent="84" relname="span">Cut close to those tiny leaves , but be sure not to damage them .</segment>
    <segment id="62" parent="83" relname="span">Pinching encourages the plant 's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves .</segment>
    <segment id="63" parent="62" relname="justify">This helps the plants grow bushy .</segment>
    <segment id="64" parent="129" relname="span">Do n't pinch on the lower part of the stem ,</segment>
    <segment id="87" parent="64" relname="antithesis">or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy .</segment>
    <segment id="65" parent="130" relname="restatement">You want them to get bushy , so pinch from the top .</segment>
    <segment id="66" parent="67" relname="preparation">2 Enjoy the basil fresh .</segment>
    <segment id="67" parent="133" relname="sequence">Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese .</segment>
    <segment id="68" parent="69" relname="preparation">3 Store the basil in the refrigerator .</segment>
    <segment id="69" parent="134" relname="span">You 'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh , so plan on storing some in the fridge .</segment>
    <segment id="70" parent="95" relname="sequence">Wash the leaves , dry them well , and wrap them in paper towels .</segment>
    <segment id="71" parent="95" relname="sequence">Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid .</segment>
    <segment id="72" parent="141" relname="preparation">4 Freeze the basil .</segment>
    <segment id="73" parent="139" relname="antithesis">Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well ,</segment>
    <segment id="78" parent="138" relname="condition">but if you puree it first</segment>
    <segment id="138" parent="139" relname="span">you can freeze it for months .</segment>
    <segment id="74" parent="81" relname="sequence">Place the basil in a blender with a little water .</segment>
    <segment id="75" parent="81" relname="sequence">Puree it until smooth ,</segment>
    <segment id="136" parent="81" relname="sequence">then put it in a food storage bag</segment>
    <segment id="137" parent="81" relname="sequence">and freeze until you need it .</segment>
