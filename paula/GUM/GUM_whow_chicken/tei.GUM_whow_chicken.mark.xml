Hours of stress , or regular exposure to stressful situations , can cause serious health problems . Get your chickens used to humans and novelty . Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect . Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help . Hens raise in battery cages stay " hypnotized " longer , possibly because of greater fear . Watch for signs of stress .
