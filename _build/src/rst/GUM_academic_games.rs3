		<segment id="6" parent="68" relname="joint">while proposing the intersection between the sets of concepts , fun and cognition , for the improvement of cognitive functions .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="41" relname="span">The attention is the main point made in this study ,</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="7" relname="cause">since it is fundamental to the learning process and be recurring complaint among parents and teachers in schools .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="40" relname="joint">With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes , researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills ( Li , Polat , Scalzo , &amp; Bavelier , 2010 ) ; on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously ( Dye &amp; Bavelier , 2010 ; Feng , Spence , &amp; Pratt , 2007 ) ; and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time ( Boot , Kramer , Simons , Fabiani , &amp; Gratton , 2008 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="40" relname="joint">Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student 's attention span at preschool age ( Rueda , Checa , &amp; Cómbita , 2012 ) , to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children ( Miller &amp; Robertson , 2010 ) , and to better performance of working memory ability ( Klingberg et al. , 2005 ; Thorell , Lindqvist , Nutley , Bohlin , &amp; Klingberg , 2009 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="70" relname="span">Considering the importance of the proper functioning of attention , because of its involvement in the regulation of thoughts and emotions ,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="69" relname="span">maintaining the performance of this process is very important , especially in school , where the child must acquire content in an environment full of countless distractors .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="73" relname="span">The study in question focuses on the attention ,</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="74" relname="span">proposing and evaluation in the context of the classroom .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="75" relname="span">Thus , it suggests the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="76" relname="joint">The games have features like increasing challenges , rules that establish what can and can not be done , and involvement of the player in the quest to gain skills and win the game ( Kirriemuir &amp; McFarlane , 2004 ; Prensky , 2005 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="18" relname="purpose">We aim to investigate the contributions of the use of a system that integrates cognitive digital games to a database , of the Escola do Cérebro , for monitoring and improvement of cognitive skills , highlighting the attention .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="77" relname="span">The games involve challenges and rules involving the exercise of cognitive functions , especially the working memory , attention and capacity of solving problems .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="52" relname="preparation">The study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="83" relname="span">It collects the data based on the observation of the proposed interventions as well as interviews conducted with participating teachers and students</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="20" relname="purpose">to identify their perceptions of digital games ’ contributions to the learning process .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="82" relname="joint">Furthermore , before and after the implementation of the intervention , we performed a D2 Test of attention that measures selective and sustained attention , as well as visual scanning accuracy and speed .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="51" relname="span">The intervention consisted in the use of the Escola do Cérebro , using tablets in the classroom , daily for a period of five weeks .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="50" relname="span">The sample consisted of 71 students of the Application School of Basic Education , Federal University of Santa Catarina , aged 7 and 9 years old ( M = 7.64 ± 1.12 ) , which were divided into two groups : participant and control .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="84" relname="contrast">The first ( n = 31 ) participated in the intervention ,</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="84" relname="contrast">the control group ( n = 40 ) was only evaluated using the test before and after the same time interval of interventions .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="55" relname="span">The Escola do Cérebro is a platform that integrates seven digital games into a database .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="54" relname="span">The application allows visualization of the player 's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="28" relname="elaboration">Students have their scores measured by four variables : time , speed , stability and accuracy .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="86" relname="background">A statistical analysis was performed based on the application of the paired t-test on the difference of the overall score obtained in the test before and after the intervention in the two groups .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="86" relname="span">The difference in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="87" relname="contrast">the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 ( 64.75 ) respectively ,</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="87" relname="contrast">while the control group was 20.00 ( 42.65 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="89" relname="joint">The result indicates significant improvement in the performance of the sustained attention in the test , as well as a high dispersion , which reveals a variation in relation to the performance .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="61" relname="joint">In addition , students participating in the interview reported a preference for games that involve problem solving , recognize the need to plan actions in relation to their importance for the game and for daily activities , and realize improvements in the ability to sustain attention .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="91" relname="span">The teachers observed changes after the intervention ,</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="36" relname="elaboration">emphasizing the greater persistence and involvement in school activities , and in some students , improvement in the ability to sustain attention .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="88" relname="span">From this , we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention .</segment>
