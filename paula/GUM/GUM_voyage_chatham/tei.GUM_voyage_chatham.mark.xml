		<!--Some of the world 's most rare and endangered birds , plants and insects . Unique tree carvings done by the peaceful Moriori people hundreds of years ago . Henga Scenic Reserve . Set adjacent to Henga Lodge is the magnificent Henga Scenic Reserve . Guests of the lodge can meander around either a short easy walk , or take the longer 2 hr return walk out onto the spectacular beach . Access is free to Lodge guests . Hapupu National Historic Scenic Reserve . One of only two National Historic Scenic Reserves in New Zealand ( the other is the Waitangi Treaty Grounds ) , Hapupu is a special place , and somewhere that you will want to tell others about . Spiritually and culturally important to Moriori , it holds the last known concentration of momori-rakau , or tree carvings done by the ancestors of today 's Moriori . There are many views on why they did these carvings , but whatever the reason , you will find them a very special attraction . Port Hutt . One of the most scenicly attractive ports in the whole of New Zealand , Port Hutt boasts an incredibly sheltered little harbour , with picturesque views and safe anchorage in all weather . Historically important and economically crucial for these islands today , Port Hutt is the ideal location for a short browse around and a mecca for those photography buffs [ 2 ] . Kopinga Marae . If you could define a place that will remind you of your visit to the Chathams , then this very special place will be at the top of your list . Opened in 2005 , Kopinga is the official meeting place of Te Imi Moriori . Adorned with contemporary Moriori carvings and traditional taonga ( treasures ) , the marae is a magnificent , tasteful and contemporary testament to the ancestors of Te Imi Moriori . Enjoy a guided tour of this beautiful and peaceful building . School-Camps At Kopinga Marae [ 3 ] also utilise this wonderful national treasure for hosting visiting school groups . Tommy Solomon Statue . Tame Horomona Rehe was the last known full-blooded Moriori and he passed away in 1933 . He was however , not the last Moriori . His own descendants and the descendants of other Moriori live on today . Come and have a look at this statue , erected in 1985 to commemorate his passing . Come and see Manakau , the property of his descendants , located on the eastern corner of Rekohu and blessed with the sun 's first rays as they rise above the sea each day .-->
