		<segment id="3" parent="51" relname="span">Replication studies are considered by many to play a fundamental role in any scientific endeavor .</segment>

		<segment id="5" parent="34" relname="span">replication studies serve to test the reliability of the previous study ’s findings .</segment>

		<segment id="7" parent="35" relname="span">they serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="37" relname="span">One indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language ( L2 ) research alone</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="8" relname="evidence">( see references for 50 calls and commentaries in Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information online ) :</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="37" relname="elaboration">from Santos ( 1989 ) through Polio and Gass 1997 to very recent proposals for specific replication studies , such as Vandergrift and Cross 2017 and even a book-length treatment ( Porte , 2012 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="41" relname="span">Beyond these calls , efforts to actively promote and facilitate replication studies have also emerged .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="39" relname="joint">For example , the Instruments for Research into Second Languages ( IRIS ) repository ( http://www.irisdatabase.org ) was established in 2011 and holds , at the time of writing , over 3,800 materials that can be used for replication , among other purposes , in L2 research ( Marsden &amp; Mackey , 2014 ; Marsden , Mackey , &amp; Plonsky , 2016 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="39" relname="joint">The Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io ) , also established in 2011 , provides a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology ( e.g. , Open Science Collaboration , 2015 ) , which continue to make waves in academia ( Laws , 2016 ; Lindsay , 2015 ; Martin &amp; Clarke , 2017 ) and the general media ( Baker , 2015 ; Devlin , 2016 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="39" relname="joint">In some fields , a flourishing metascience , that is , the scientific study of science ( see Munafò et al. , 2017 ) , has included syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts , for example , in education ( Makel &amp; Plucker , 2014 and in psychology ( Makel et al. , 2012 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="55" relname="span">The driving force behind this battery of calls , commentaries , infrastructure , and metascience is a perceived crisis in the state of replication research .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="53" relname="span">The severe concerns underpinning the alleged crisis have several dimensions relating to : (a) the ( small ) amount of published replication research ; (b) the ( poor ) quality of replication research ; and (c) the ( lack of ) reproducibility , which refers to the extent to which findings can ( not ) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="70" relname="span">These concerns speak to the very core of science ,</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration">raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="55" relname="antithesis">Indeed , some commentators have called replication the “ gold standard ” of research evidence ( Jasny , Chin , Chong , &amp; Vignieri , 2011 , p. 1225 ) and a “ linchpin of the scientific process ” ( Let ’s replicate , 2006 , p. 330 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="61" relname="concession">In the field of L2 research , given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified , one might expect a substantial number of published replication studies by now .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="22" relname="cause">However , a perceived lack of prestige , excitement , and originality of replication plagues L2 research ( Porte , 2012 ) , as it does other disciplines ( Berez-Kroeker et al. , 2017 ; Branco , Cohen , Vossen , Ide , &amp; Calzolari , 2017 ; Chambers , 2017 ; Schmidt , 2009 ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="61" relname="span">and these perceptions are thought to have caused , at least in part ( directly or indirectly ) , alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="60" relname="span">However , a systematic metascience on replication research has not yet been established in the field of L2 research ,</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="23" relname="result">leaving a poor understanding of the actual number and nature of replication studies that have been published .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="47" relname="span">The current study begins to address this gap through narrative and systematic reviews .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="46" relname="span">The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology , given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research , and also from education , another key sister discipline .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="26" relname="elaboration">The narrative review is organized around four broad themes : (a) the quantity of replication research , (b) the nature of replication research , (c) the relationship between initial and replication studies , and (d) the interpretation and extent of reproducibility of the findings of initial studies .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="29" relname="purpose">To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research ,</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="43" relname="span">the systematic review provides a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self-labeled as replications .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="43" relname="elaboration">The research questions and methods of the systematic review were largely determined by the narrative review but also emerged through the design and piloting of the coding instrument .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="45" relname="joint">Finally , we offer further discussion and 16 recommendations for future replication work that draw on our narrative and systematic reviews and on our experience of carrying out multisite ( Morgan-Short et al. , 2018 ) 1 and single site ( Faretta-Stutenberg &amp; Morgan-Short , 2011 ; Marsden , Williams , &amp; Liu , 2013 ; McManus &amp; Marsden , 2017 ; Morgan-Short , Heil , Botero-Moriaty , &amp; Ebert , 2012 ) replications .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="47" relname="elaboration">We start from the widely agreed premise that testing the reproducibility of findings should have an essential role in the testing and refinement of theory , at least for hypothesis-testing epistemologies that seek to ascertain generalizability and for other epistemologies in which constructs are deemed to be definable and observable .</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="48" relname="purpose">Thus , our overall aim is to provide conceptual clarification and an empirical base for future discussion and production of replication studies , with a view to improving the amount and quality of L2 replication research .</segment>
