Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area , he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany , but did not win , and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later . In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition , including scores of two further symphonies and other works .

The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 [ a ] and again in 1876 and in 1877 , when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick , also a member of the jury , made themselves known to him . Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher , Simrock , who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances , Op. 46 . These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878 , the sheet music ( of the original piano 4-hands version ) had excellent sales , and Dvořák 's international reputation was launched at last .-->

		<!--Dvořák 's first piece of a religious nature , his setting of Stabat Mater , was premiered in Prague in 1880 . It was very successfully performed in London in 1883 , leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States . [ 2 ] In his career , Dvořák made nine invited visits to England , often conducting performances of his own works . His Seventh Symphony was written for London . Visiting Russia in March 1890 , he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg . [ 3 ] In 1891 Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory . In 1890 – 91 , he wrote his Dumky Trio , one of his most successful chamber music pieces . In 1892 , Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City . While in the United States , Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works : the Symphony From the New World , which spread his reputation worldwide , [ 4 ] and his Cello Concerto , one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti . He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music , the American String Quartet , during this time . But shortfalls in payment of his salary , along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness , led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895 .-->
