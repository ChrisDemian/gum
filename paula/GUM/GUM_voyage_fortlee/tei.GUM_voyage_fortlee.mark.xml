		<!--Most people choose cars , but if headed to a central area , such as Main Street , it is best to drive there , park in a municipal parking lot , and walk around from there . Since so much of the town ’s retail area is clustered in 3 or 4 block radius , it would be beneficial to walk around , but might also be dangerous given the high traffic intersections . If walking use caution , and if parking , make sure to feed the meter with plenty of pocket change ; the meter maids take their job very seriously . Since fort lee is situated in such a convenient area for those commuting to and from the city , there is often high traffic and congestion on the roads . If you are planning on being somewhere at a certain time , one might suggest leaving a good 10 to 15 minutes to escape local traffic before hitting any major roadways .-->
