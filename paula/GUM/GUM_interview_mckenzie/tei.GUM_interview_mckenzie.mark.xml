		<!--We always seem to have just a little bit of a chill out at the World Cup . I do n't know why . It 's really strange occurrence , over the years . 2002 World Cup , we won bronze . Then in 2006 we ended up fourth . It was one of the worst World Cups we 've played actually . And then in 2010 we just ... I do n't know what happened . We just did n't play as well as we thought we would . Came fourth . But you know what ? Fired us up for the actual Paralympics . So the World Cup is ... it 's good to be able to do well at the World Cup , to be placed , but it also means that you get a really good opportunity to know where you 're at in that two year gap between the Paralympics . So you can come back home and revisit what you need to do and , you know , where the team 's at . And all that sort of stuff .-->
