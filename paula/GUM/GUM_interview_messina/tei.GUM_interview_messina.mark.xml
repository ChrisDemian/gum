It was amazing . We did n't use the banner this year , though , because we did n't know . The team was n't so far ahead that we knew . Last year we just knew we were going to the playoffs ; we knew we were going post-season . This year we were n't sure . We were walking on eggshells . There was a woman , a season ticket holder and a die hard fan . She was staggered by the loss last year to the Cardinals . Last year she came up to me during one of the games late in the season ; she was so happy we were going to the post season . By that point we had clinched it . She handed me a shirt she bought at the stadium and she gave me a big hug . With tears in her eyes she said , " Thank you , Mets Poet , thank you . " It 's cool ... it 's like another family .-->
