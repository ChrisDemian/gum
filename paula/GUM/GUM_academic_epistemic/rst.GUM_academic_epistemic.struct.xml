Insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise , it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization . When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession , it introduces an epistemic pollutant . A yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies ’ commercial products [ 23 ] . The companies hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals to endow their promotional “ research ” with an air of reliability . When the deceit was uncovered , however , the effect was just the opposite : the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by Elsevier , but rather the legitimacy of Elsevier ’s publications — and , by extension , all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research .-->

Insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise , it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization .

Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise , it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions . Epistemic pollution may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions . 9 For example , pollution may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise . Consider institutions with a credentialing function , such as universities , bar associations , or peer review bodies . These institutions do not exist solely to credential experts . They have other functions , and these functions may come into conflict , creating pressures to inflate credentials . For example , universities have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff , thereby increasing their rankings , bringing in grant money , and attracting students . Systems that assess expertise can be manipulated , and many cases of such manipulation exist — take the recent example by the University of Malaysia , which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [ 28 ] . For this reason , institutions may also be slow to investigate accusations of fraud , and they may try to keep their discoveries in-house to protect their reputations .-->

This fact , together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur , reduces ordinary people ’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources . For instance , those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise , taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in . There are some egregious examples of this practice in the field of health care . For example , a small number of doctors set up the American College of Pediatricians ( ACPeds ) to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care . Such an organization is surely permissible , but it has had the unfortunate ( and likely intended ) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large . Thus , when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [ 21 ] , many people mistook the organization ’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians — although the peak body for pediatric workers , the American Academy of Pediatrics , has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [ 22 ] . Insofar as the larger organization , with a broader membership base , can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise , it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization . When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession , it introduces an epistemic pollutant . A yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies ’ commercial products [ 23 ] . The companies hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals to endow their promotional “ research ” with an air of reliability . When the deceit was uncovered , however , the effect was just the opposite : the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by Elsevier , but rather the legitimacy of Elsevier ’s publications — and , by extension , all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research . More recently , institutions of academic expertise have been subject to a large and growing outbreak of so-called predatory journals — journals that will publish almost anything for a fee . Once again , this phenomenon has the effect of making peer-reviewed journals appear less legitimate . At times , even those who work in academia may be unsure of a particular journal ’s legitimacy , and there are genuine borderline cases . For example , the Frontiers contingent of journals appears legitimate — at least to me — despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee . 8 Yet some Frontiers journals appear to have engaged in bad behavior , whether for profit or for some other motive . Frontiers in Public Health controversially published articles linking vaccines and autism [ 24 ] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [ 25 ] . Whether due to this behavior or not , Jeffrey Beall decided to add the publisher to his influential ( but now sadly unavailable ) list of questionable journals [ 26 ] . The controversy surrounding Beall ’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals . If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate , one can not reasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments . If their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution , one can hardly blame them . Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise , it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions . Epistemic pollution may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions . 9 For example , pollution may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise . Consider institutions with a credentialing function , such as universities , bar associations , or peer review bodies . These institutions do not exist solely to credential experts . They have other functions , and these functions may come into conflict , creating pressures to inflate credentials . For example , universities have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff , thereby increasing their rankings , bringing in grant money , and attracting students . Systems that assess expertise can be manipulated , and many cases of such manipulation exist — take the recent example by the University of Malaysia , which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [ 28 ] . For this reason , institutions may also be slow to investigate accusations of fraud , and they may try to keep their discoveries in-house to protect their reputations .-->
