		<segment id="2" parent="42" relname="span">Byron received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School , and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie , in Dulwich . [ 17 ]</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="4" relname="circumstance">Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey ,</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="46" relname="span">he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but not restrain himself from " violent " bouts in an attempt to overcompensate for his deformed foot .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="33" relname="joint">His mother interfered with his studies , often withdrawing him from school , with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected .</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="48" relname="span">In 1801 , he was sent to Harrow , where he remained until July 1805 . [ 6 ]</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="8" relname="concession">An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="35" relname="span">, he did represent the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord 's in 1805 . [ 19 ]</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="44" relname="preparation">His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="36" relname="span">Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth , whom he met while at school , [ 6 ]</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="10" relname="result">and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="37" relname="joint">His mother wrote , " He has no indisposition that I know of but love , desperate love , the worst of all maladies in my opinion . In short , the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth . " [ 6 ]</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="37" relname="joint">In Byron 's later memoirs , " Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings . " [ 20 ]</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="38" relname="span">Byron finally returned in January 1804 , [ 6 ] to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys , which he recalled with great vividness :</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="14" relname="evidence">" My school friendships were with me passions ( for I was always violent ) . " [ 21 ]</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="39" relname="joint">The most enduring of those was with John FitzGibbon , 2nd Earl of Clare — four years Byron 's junior — whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy ( 1821 ) . [ 22 ]</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="39" relname="joint">His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships , Childish Recollections ( 1806 ) , express a prescient " consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him . " [ 23 ]</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="39" relname="joint">Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow , John Thomas Claridge .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="39" relname="background">John FitzGibbon , 2nd Earl of Clare</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="21" relname="preparation">Ah !</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="58" relname="span">Sure some stronger impulse vibrates here , Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear To one , who thus for kindred hearts must roam , And seek abroad , the love denied at home .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="51" relname="circumstance">The following autumn , he went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , [ 24 ]</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="51" relname="span">where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="40" relname="joint">About his " protégé " he wrote , " He has been my almost constant associate since October , 1805 , when I entered Trinity College . His voice first attracted my attention , his countenance fixed it , and his manners attached me to him for ever . "</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="40" relname="joint">In his memory Byron composed Thyrza , a series of elegies . [ 25 ]</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="43" relname="span">In later years , he described the affair as " a violent , though pure love and passion " .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="53" relname="span">This statement , however , needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions ( including public hanging ) against convicted or even suspected offenders . [ 26 ]</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="27" relname="concession">The liaison , on the other hand , may well have been " pure " out of respect for Edleston 's innocence , in contrast to the ( probably ) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School . [ 27 ]</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="41" relname="span">Byron spent three years at Trinity College ,</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="54" relname="joint">engaging in sexual escapades , boxing , horse riding and gambling . [ 28 ]</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="32" relname="circumstance">Also while at Cambridge</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="55" relname="span">he formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse , who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club , which endorsed liberal politics , [ 28 ] and Francis Hodgson , a Fellow at King 's College , with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life .</segment>
