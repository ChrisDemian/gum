		<segment id="10" parent="56" relname="solutionhood">What is the most important aspect of your background that voters should know about ?</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="88" relname="joint">I am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia ,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="89" relname="span">but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth .</segment>

		<segment id="23" parent="80" relname="span">More recently , he erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases ,</segment>

		<segment id="25" parent="58" relname="joint">He could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform , regulatory reform , and school choice .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="58" relname="joint">Of course , he showed ethical lapses in judgment .</segment>

		<segment id="38" parent="96" relname="span">There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature ,</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="38" relname="evaluation">and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governor .</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="96" relname="justify">Libertarians share many policy positions with each of the major parties .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="101" relname="circumstance">Working together with both Republicans and Democrats ,</segment>

		<segment id="44" parent="108" relname="background">Moreover , electing a third-party governor represents a repudiation of politics as usual ,</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="108" relname="span">and the major party legislators will face changed constraints and incentives ,</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="45" relname="result">meaning that much more is possible than many people assume , especially with strong leadership .</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="83" relname="solutionhood">Which previous Virginia Governor(s) do you most admire and why ?</segment>
