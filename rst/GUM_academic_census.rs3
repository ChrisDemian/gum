		<segment id="1" parent="108" relname="preparation">1 Introduction</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="74" relname="background">Tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress , both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers .</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="73" relname="span">Past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity , including ethnic , racial , and gender diversity .</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="87" relname="span">As an example , research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [ 1 ] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [ 2 , 3 ]</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="4" relname="cause">by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers .</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="72" relname="joint">Additionally , diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [ 4 ] , which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="73" relname="concession">Despite these positive effects , however , quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult , due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="56" relname="span">Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce , particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science , is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="88" relname="span">For many scientific fields , however , there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty ,</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="result">making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="89" relname="joint">Further , rates of adoption of services like GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within , and across disciplines .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="91" relname="contrast">For instance , gender representation in computing is an important issue with broad implications [ 5 ] ,</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="91" relname="contrast">but without a full census of computing faculty , the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [ 6 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="92" relname="contrast">Some disciplines , like political science , are organized around a single professional society , whose membership roll approximates a full census [ 7 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="93" relname="span">Most fields , on the other hand , including computer science , lack a single all-encompassing organization</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="elaboration">and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists , such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="18" relname="cause">Because assembling such a full census is difficult ,</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="95" relname="span">past studies have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [ 8 – 11 ] , usually specific to a particular field [ 12 – 16 ] , and often focused on the scientific elite [ 17 , 18 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="20" relname="concession">Although useful ,</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="94" relname="span">such samples are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability .</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="62" relname="span">One of the largest census efforts to date assembled , by hand , a nearly complete record of three academic fields : computer science , history , and business [ 19 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="98" relname="contrast">This data set has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training , placement , and scholarly productivity [ 6 , 19 , 20 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="98" relname="contrast">But , this data set is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="104" relname="span">In some fields , yearly data on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="24" relname="elaboration">In computer science , the Computing Research Association ( CRA ) documents trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America ( cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey ) .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="78" relname="span">Such surveys can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="77" relname="joint">First , surveys are subject to variable response rates and the misinterpretation of questions or sample frames , which can inject bias into fine-grained analyses [ 21 , 22 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="63" relname="span">Second , aggregate information provides only a high-level view of a field , which can make it difficult to investigate causality [ 23 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="105" relname="span">For example , differences in recruitment and retention strategies across departments will be washed out by averaging ,</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="29" relname="result">thereby masking any insights into the efficacy of individual strategies and policies .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="112" relname="span">Here , we present a novel system , based on a topical web crawler , that can quickly and automatically assemble a full census of an academic field using digital data available on the public World Wide Web .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="111" relname="joint">This system is efficient and accurate ,</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="111" relname="joint">and it can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="113" relname="span">The system is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="34" relname="elaboration">using off-the-shelf computing hardware ,</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="113" relname="evaluation">a vast improvement over the roughly 1600 hours required to do this task by hand [ 19 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="116" relname="span">By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone ,</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="37" relname="result">this system will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="116" relname="elaboration">by providing access to complete faculty listings ,</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="115" relname="antithesis">without having to rely on surveys or professional societies .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="118" relname="span">This system can also be used longitudinally</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="purpose">to study how the workforce ’s composition changes over time ,</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="118" relname="evaluation">which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="70" relname="joint">Finally , applied to many academic fields in parallel , the system can elucidate scientists ’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances .</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="75" relname="evaluation">In short , many important research questions will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently-recollected census data .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="55" relname="preparation">Our study is organized as follows .</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="55" relname="sequence">We begin by detailing the design and implementation of our web crawler framework .</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="65" relname="span">Next , we present the results of our work in two sections .</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="100" relname="span">The first demonstrates the validity and utility of the crawler</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="101" relname="sequence">by collecting census data for the field of computer science</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="101" relname="sequence">and comparing it to a hand-curated census , collected in 2011 [ 19 ] .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="102" relname="span">The second provides an example of the type of research enabled by our system</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="103" relname="span">and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="53" relname="purpose">to investigate the “ leaky pipeline ” problem in faculty retention .</segment>
