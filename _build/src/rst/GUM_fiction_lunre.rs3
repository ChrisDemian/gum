		<segment id="2" parent="55" relname="span">My father ’s actions were largely incomprehensible to me ,</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="2" relname="justify">guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations .</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="55" relname="elaboration">He dwelt in another world , a world of intrigue , bargains , contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="56" relname="evaluation">He was in many ways a world in himself , whole as a sphere .</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="63" relname="concession">No doubt his decisions were perfectly logical in his own eyes —</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="68" relname="span">even the one that prompted him , a patriotic islander , to bring me a tutor from Bain : Master Lunre , an Olondrian .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="65" relname="span">The day began</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="66" relname="span">as it usually did</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="condition">when my father was expected home from his travels ,</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="74" relname="span">the house festooned with flowers and stocked with coconut liquor .</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="75" relname="span">We stood by the gate ,</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="76" relname="joint">washed and perfumed and arrayed in our brightest clothes ,</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="76" relname="joint">my mother twisting her hands in her skirt ,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="76" relname="joint">my father ’s wife with red eyes .</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="72" relname="contrast">Jom , grown taller and broad in the shoulders , moaned gently to himself ,</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="72" relname="contrast">while I stood nervously rubbing the heel of one sandal on the flagstones .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="69" relname="sequence">We scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company ,</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="20" relname="circumstance">but before we saw them</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="77" relname="span">we heard the children shouting : “ A yellow man ! ”</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="77" relname="evaluation">A yellow man !</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="79" relname="joint">We glanced at one another in confusion .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="79" relname="joint">My mother bit her lower lip ;</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="79" relname="joint">Jom gave a groan of alarm .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="60" relname="span">At first I thought the children meant my father , whose golden skin , the color of the night-monkey ’s pelt , was a rarity in the islands ;</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="25" relname="evaluation">but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father , and would never have greeted a council-member with such ill-mannered yells .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="59" relname="background">Then I remembered the only “ yellow man ” I had ever seen , an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood , who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes , attached to his ears with wires , and roamed the hills of Tinimavet , cutting bits off the trees .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="29" relname="concession">I have since learned that that doctor wrote a well-received treatise , On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut , and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel ;</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="59" relname="span">but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree-cuttings .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="82" relname="span">“ There they are , ” said Pavit , the head house-servant , in a strained voice .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="83" relname="span">And there they were :</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="86" relname="span">a chain of riders weaving among the trees .</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="32" relname="elaboration">My father ’s plaited umbrella appeared , his still , imposing figure , and beside him another man , tall and lean , astride an island mule .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="35" relname="cause">The hectic screams of the children preceded the company into the village ,</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="87" relname="span">so that they advanced like a festival ,</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="87" relname="result">drawing people out of their houses .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="88" relname="circumstance">As they approached</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="88" relname="joint">I saw that my father ’s face was shining with pride ,</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="88" relname="joint">and his bearing had in it a new hauteur , like that of the old island kings .</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="93" relname="span">The man who rode beside him , looking uncomfortable with his long legs , kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="95" relname="joint">He was not yellow , but very pale brown , the color of raw cashews ;</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="94" relname="span">he had silver hair , worn cropped close to the skull</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="42" relname="evaluation">so that it resembled a cap .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="95" relname="joint">He was not the leaf-collecting doctor , but an altogether strange man , with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine-knuckled hands .</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="46" relname="circumstance">As he dismounted in front of the house</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="96" relname="span">I heard my mother whispering : “ Protect us , God with the Black-and-White Tail , from that which is not of this earth . ”</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="97" relname="span">My father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us ,</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="47" relname="elaboration">grinning .</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="69" relname="sequence">I thought I caught an odor off him , of fish , sea-sickness and sweat .</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="98" relname="sequence">We knelt and stared down at the bald ground ,</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="98" relname="sequence">murmuring ritual greetings ,</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="98" relname="sequence">until he touched the tops of our heads with the palm of his fleshy hand .</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="99" relname="span">Then we stood ,</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="53" relname="circumstance">unable to keep from staring at the stranger , who faced us awkwardly , half-smiling , taller than any man there .</segment>
