Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat . Add the quinoa and cook for about 1 minute . This brings out quinoa 's nutty flavor . Cook the quinoa . Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil . Cover and reduce heat to low . Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain . Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ , in the same way as pasta . Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat . Take the quinoa off the heat and let stand , covered , for 5 minutes . This will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan . Uncover and fluff with a fork . The quinoa should look light and fluffy , and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed . Serve . Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately to retain nutritional value and a good flavor . Serve with : Stir-fry , using the quinoa as a substitute for rice . Curry . Braised meat . In a salad . Virtually any other combination you can think of !-->
