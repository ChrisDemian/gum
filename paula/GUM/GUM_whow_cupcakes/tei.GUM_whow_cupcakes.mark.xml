		<!--Method 1 of 2 : Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes . Preheat the oven to 180 oC / 350 oF . Prepare the muffin tray by adding cupcake holders / cases . Put to one side . Alternatively , use a silicone cupcake baking sheet with molded holes . Put the cider vinegar into a small bowl and add the soy milk . Stir this well and then put to one side . The mixture will now curdle and this is what should be happening . Stir together the flour , sugar , baking powder , baking soda and salt . If you want chocolate cupcakes , add cocoa ( about 1/2 cup ) to this stage . Stir the oil and vanilla extract into the bowl containing the soy milk and vinegar . Mix together . Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat together ( by hand or with an electric hand-held mixer ) . Fill the muffin pan . Usually fill each paper cupcake holder with about 1/4 cup of batter . If you prefer larger cupcakes , then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger . Bake for 18 - 20 minutes . If you can smell the cupcakes earlier , check to make sure they are n't browning earlier ( this means they 're more than ready ) . If you are n't certain , turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks . Wait for the pan to cool down . Place cupcakes onto a wire rack to cool . Ice the cupcakes . The flavor of icing or frosting can be improved by adding a little of your favorite juice to it instead of soy milk or water . Finished .-->

		<!--Method 1 of 2 : Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes . Preheat the oven to 180 oC / 350 oF . Prepare the muffin tray by adding cupcake holders / cases . Put to one side . Alternatively , use a silicone cupcake baking sheet with molded holes . Put the cider vinegar into a small bowl and add the soy milk . Stir this well and then put to one side . The mixture will now curdle and this is what should be happening . Stir together the flour , sugar , baking powder , baking soda and salt . If you want chocolate cupcakes , add cocoa ( about 1/2 cup ) to this stage . Stir the oil and vanilla extract into the bowl containing the soy milk and vinegar . Mix together . Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat together ( by hand or with an electric hand-held mixer ) . Fill the muffin pan . Usually fill each paper cupcake holder with about 1/4 cup of batter . If you prefer larger cupcakes , then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger . Bake for 18 - 20 minutes . If you can smell the cupcakes earlier , check to make sure they are n't browning earlier ( this means they 're more than ready ) . If you are n't certain , turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks . Wait for the pan to cool down . Place cupcakes onto a wire rack to cool . Ice the cupcakes . The flavor of icing or frosting can be improved by adding a little of your favorite juice to it instead of soy milk or water . Finished . Method 2 of 2 : Basic Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes Preheat the oven to 160 oC / 315 oF . If using cupcake cases , arrange on a baking sheet now . If using a silicone cupcake sheet , simply have it ready . Add the flour , cocoa powder , baking soda and pinch of salt to the mixing bowl . Mix to combine . Pour the soy milk , vinegar , sugar , oil and vanilla into another bowl . Whisk together well . Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture . Stir to combine thoroughly . Pour into the cupcake cases or cupcake holes . Place into the oven . Bake for 20 to 25 minutes . If they smell strongly earlier , test with a wooden skewer ; if it returns clean after sticking into a cupcake , they 're ready . Remove from the oven . Transfer the cupcakes to a wire cooling rack as quickly as possible when cool enough to handle . Let cool completely on the rack . Frost as desired . Add standard frosting or make vegan butter cream .-->

The cupcakes will not be as light and fluffy , however , so be prepared for a heavier cupcake if you add fruit but the added moisture content is a definite plus . Instead of using vegan sugar , you can replace it with equal parts maple sugar or rice syrup Instead of using vegetable oil , try substituting it for walnut or macadamia nut oils if they are available to you . Coconut oil also produces good results . And olive oil works fine if it 's all that 's left in the pantry . You can replace the plain soy milk with other flavors like chocolate or vanilla if you want to experiment with changing the flavor of the cupcakes . Experiment with the flavors of either recipe by replacing the vanilla extract with fragrant ingredients like neroli orange oil , rosewater , orange blossom water or coconut extract .-->
