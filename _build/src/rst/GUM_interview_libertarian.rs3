    <segment id="10" parent="46" relname="span">I am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia , but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth .</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="justify">( I am mixed-race ( half-Chinese ) and in an interracial marriage . )</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="47" relname="span">I am the only candidate who has studied both economics and law , and the only candidate with a background in technology entrepreneurship .</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="52" relname="evidence">Because of my academic and professional background ,</segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="54" relname="span">I understand the issues and challenges facing Virginia much better than the other candidates , and I am offering real solutions that can be appreciated across the political spectrum .</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="44" relname="joint">I am the only candidate who believes in both economic freedom and personal liberty and the only candidate who stands on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law .</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="51" relname="solutionhood">What are your thoughts on the job Bob McDonnell has done as Governor of Virginia ? What would you have done differently than him ?</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="50" relname="span">McDonnell did well early in his term pushing back against Senate Democrats who wanted huge tax increases in response to major revenue shortfalls during the recession .</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="evaluation">Those early budget efforts are his highest achievements as Governor .</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="51" relname="joint">More recently , he erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases ,</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="18" relname="antithesis">rather than prioritizing spending and seeking more rational , efficient , decentralized transportation decision-making .</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="51" relname="joint">He could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform , regulatory reform , and school choice .</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="51" relname="joint">Of course , he showed ethical lapses in judgment .</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="background">Compared to previous third party candidates at the gubernatorial level , you have done exceptionally well in opinion polling .</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="49" relname="span">What do you attribute that success to ?</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="59" relname="span">Voters see the two-party system for the sham it has become .</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="56" relname="span">They are sick of the partisanship and nonsense and the total lack of substance in modern campaigns .</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="24" relname="elaboration">Voters see the two major party nominees as exemplifying what is worst about their respective parties ,</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="56" relname="antithesis">and they want something better .</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="58" relname="span">Voters who meet me and hear me speak know that I am sincere , know that I understand the issues deeply and have workable solutions , and know that I stand on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law and the public interest .</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="26" relname="justify">People like the fact that I stand for a Virginia that is both Open-minded and Open for Business .</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="61" relname="condition">If elected governor ,</segment>
    <segment id="61" parent="66" relname="span">how will you be able to implement your agenda while dealing with a hostile legislature ?</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="62" relname="span">There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature , and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governor .</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="29" relname="justify">Libertarians share many policy positions with each of the major parties .</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="62" relname="elaboration">Working together with both Republicans and Democrats , we can get the good aspects of each party while rejecting the bad parts of both .</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="65" relname="span">Moreover , electing a third-party governor represents a repudiation of politics as usual , and the major party legislators will face changed constraints and incentives ,</segment>
    <segment id="63" parent="31" relname="result">meaning that much more is possible than many people assume , especially with strong leadership .</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="33" relname="solutionhood">Which previous Virginia Governor(s) do you most admire and why ?</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="68" relname="span">Thomas Jefferson .</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="45" relname="span">He was incredibly learned and was a strong advocate for freedom and the rule of law .</segment>
