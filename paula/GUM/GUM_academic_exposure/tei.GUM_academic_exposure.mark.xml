		<!--Research on adult-learned second language ( L2 ) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [ 1 ] – [ 11 ] . Of interest here , studies suggest that , despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar , adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [ 12 ] – [ 15 ] . However , it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels . Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 . In fact , substantial periods ( months to years ) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon , and may even be the norm [ 16 ] . Such a scenario may be found in different situations , including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [ 19 ] . In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar : that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native-like neural processes ( “ use it or lose it ” [ 20 ] ) , no such changes , or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native-like processing may be observed . Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts .-->

Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [ 22 ] . Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] . It remains unclear what might explain such gains , which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [ 24 ] , or to factors related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training [ 18 ] .-->
