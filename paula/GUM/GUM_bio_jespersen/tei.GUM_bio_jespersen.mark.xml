		<!--Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland . He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy , and with the help of Rask 's grammars taught himself some Icelandic , Italian , and Spanish . He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17 , initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies . In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages , and in 1887 earned his master 's degree in French , with English and Latin as his secondary languages . He supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament . In 1887 – 1888 , he traveled to England , Germany and France , meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University . Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen , he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system . He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891 .-->

The term Nexus is applied to sentences , structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation , in which two concepts are expressed in one unit ; e.g. , it rained , he ran indoors . This term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea , expressed by means of two or more elements , whereas a nexus combines two ideas . Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics .-->
