		<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="purpose">to explore , using eye-tracking techniques , aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="56" relname="background">Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="25" relname="circumstance">When regarding an artwork ,</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="46" relname="span">a viewer gathers information through a series fixations , interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="90" relname="span">The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene ( e.g. colour , texture , brightness etc ) .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="26" relname="evaluation">Importantly , studying eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="89" relname="span">Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts</segment>

		<segment id="30" parent="88" relname="joint">and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit ( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich &amp; Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="80" relname="span">Zurbarán ’s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="31" relname="elaboration">It is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the UK , and one of very few of its kind in the world .</segment>

		<segment id="34" parent="48" relname="span">but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="53" relname="span">In this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham , of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks ( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks , the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond ) are a key part of ,</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="35" relname="purpose">to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art , how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="53" relname="elaboration">This pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit , namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour .</segment>
