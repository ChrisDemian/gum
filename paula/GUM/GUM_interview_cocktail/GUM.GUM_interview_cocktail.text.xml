<body>Wikinews interviews New York bar owner on Santorum cocktail Thursday , March 15 , 2012 Wikinews interviewed one of the owners of a New York City bar about a popular new politically-themed cocktail drink called Santorum . The beverage was inspired by the santorum neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage &apos;s column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality ; Savage &apos;s readers voted to define santorum as ; &quot; the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex . &quot; Background The santorum neologism has inspired satirical forms of parody , including this political cartoon by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal webcomic artist Zach Weiner . 2012 . Image ; Zach Weiner . The Pacific Standard bar is located in Brooklyn , New York , and is co-owned by Jonathan M. Stan and John-Christian G. Rauschenberg . Stan commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail , &quot; When he was winning in the polls , I thought , &apos; OK , I &apos;ll do a Santorum &apos; . &quot; Regarding how long the beverage will be made available , Stan remarked to The Brooklyn Paper , &quot; We &apos;ll keep it around until he ’s irrelevant . I hope he ’s there the whole way &quot; . The main ingredients of the Santorum drink include vodka of an orange citrus variety , Baileys Irish Cream , and Angostura bitters . It is served in a cocktail glass and topped with Godiva chocolate flakes . The beverage is priced at US $ 8.00 , and upon an order for it , the bartender will recount for the customer the definition of the santorum neologism . Troy Patterson of Slate Magazine ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar . After tasting the beverage , Patterson observed , &quot; My Santorum was sweet but balanced , with a subtle citrus pucker &quot; . [ The santorum neologism is ] offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . — Rick Santorum In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press , Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality . Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator ’s last name , and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon . The term became a prominent result in searches online , and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google , Bing , and Yahoo! . Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon ; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google &apos;s response ; &quot; To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they ca n&apos;t handle . I suspect that &apos;s not true . &quot; Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview , saying , &quot; It &apos;s offensive beyond , you know , anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate , and the mainstream media laughs about it . &quot; Interview Pacific Standard owner , Jonathan M. Stan , displays the Santorum cocktail drink as a finished product at the bar . ( 2012 ) . Image ; Pacific Standard , provided by the owners . Interview What inspired you to create a cocktail after the santorum neologism ? Santorum the person has been in the news throughout the primary season , and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of &quot; santorum . &quot; How did you first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the Savage Love advice column ? We do n&apos;t really remember . It &apos;s been around forever . Probably read about it somewhere . What are your thoughts about Rick Santorum ’s views on gay rights ? It &apos;s not for us to take a stand on any political issues . We &apos;ll leave that to the professionals . Do you think it was an appropriate form of satire for Dan Savage to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column ? We thought it was funny . Whether it is appropriate or not is another thing we leave to the pros to decide . When was the Santorum cocktail first created ? A few months ago . What ingredients go in the Santorum cocktail ? Bailey &apos;s , orange vodka , bitters , and chocolate flakes . How is the Santorum drink made ? The ingredients are shaken and/or poured into a cocktail glass . See the pictures . Your Santorum cocktail creation has already received media coverage from publications including ; The Brooklyn Paper , The New York Times , Jezebel , Metro.us , EDGE on the Net , and Instinct Magazine . Did you think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage ? Not at all . We were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy . What culinary dishes would you recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail ? You &apos;d probably be having the cocktail at dessert time , so something sweet ; ice cream or pie . Is the drink popular ? How many times do you suppose you ’ve served it at your establishment since its creation ? The drink was mildly popular for the last few months , but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity . We have no way to estimate how many times we &apos;ve served it overall , but we &apos;re now pouring around ten a night . </body>
