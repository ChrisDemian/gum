		<segment id="7" parent="53" relname="span">I had one granddaughter who survived the war .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="104" relname="sequence">I saw her sometimes : in a bright pink dress , a sparkling drink in her hand , on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders , at the edge of a marble patio .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="56" relname="span">She never looked back at me —</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="cause">poverty and failure and political disrepute being all , these days , contagious and synonymous .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="59" relname="joint">The young were mostly dead ,</segment>

		<segment id="29" parent="79" relname="span">But I followed the traveler , into the wet streets .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="78" relname="joint">The smell of fish oozed from the docks .</segment>

		<segment id="35" parent="81" relname="span">She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room , a little fermented .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="35" relname="elaboration">A heady smell .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="38" relname="circumstance">In the morning , brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor ,</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="84" relname="span">and the traveler and her pack were gone .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="88" relname="span">I hurried home .</segment>

		<segment id="42" parent="88" relname="elaboration">My house was empty and cold .</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="92" relname="sequence">I packed six loaves of flatbread , some olives , a hard cheese , one nice dress , walking clothes , my pills and glasses , a jug of wine , a can-teen of water , and a kitchen knife .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="91" relname="span">I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while ,</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="44" relname="elaboration">looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting .</segment>
