		<segment id="12" parent="69" relname="elaboration">Sometime in this period , Nida became a founding charter member of Wycliffe Bible Translators , a related organization to the Summer Institute of Linguistics .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="74" relname="span">In 1937 , Nida undertook studies at the University of Southern California , where he obtained a master 's degree in New Testament Greek in 1939 .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">In that same year he became interim pastor of Calvary Church of Santa Ana , California following the resignation of its founding pastor .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="72" relname="sequence">Despite his conservative background , in later years Nida became increasingly ecumenical and New Evangelical ( clarification needed ) in his approach .</segment>

		<segment id="23" parent="102" relname="preparation">Theories</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="102" relname="span">Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="75" relname="joint">His Ph.D. dissertation , A Synopsis of English Syntax , was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the " immediate-constituent " theory .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="76" relname="span">His textbook Morphology : The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="26" relname="elaboration">It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="77" relname="span">His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence , also known as Functional Equivalence .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="28" relname="elaboration">For more information , see " Dynamic and formal equivalence . "</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="80" relname="span">Nida also developed the componential analysis technique , which split words into their components</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="30" relname="purpose">to help determine equivalence in translation</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="79" relname="span">( e.g. " bachelor " = male + unmarried ) .</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="34" relname="concession">This is , perhaps , not the best example of the technique ,</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="78" relname="span">though it is the most well-known .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="83" relname="span">Nida 's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text ( ST ) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page , and that meaning is self-contained within the text</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="35" relname="elaboration">( i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence ) .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="108" relname="span">This theory , along with other theories of correspondence in translating , are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence , where Nida begins by asserting that given that " no two languages are identical , either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences ,</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="37" relname="restatement">it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="107" relname="span">Hence , there can be no fully exact translations . "</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="41" relname="concession">While the impact of a translation may be close to the original ,</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="84" relname="span">there can be no identity in detail .</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="93" relname="preparation">Nida then sets forth the differences in translation , as he would account for it , within three basic factors :</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="86" relname="preparation">The nature of the message :</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="86" relname="contrast">in some messages the content is of primary consideration ,</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="86" relname="contrast">and in others the form must be given a higher priority .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="89" relname="preparation">The purpose of the author and of the translator :</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="89" relname="joint">to give information on both form and content ;</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="88" relname="span">to aim at full intelligibility of the reader</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="48" relname="purpose">so he / she may understand the full implications of the message ;</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="87" relname="joint">for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="87" relname="joint">but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="53" relname="preparation">The type of audience :</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="90" relname="span">prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest .</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="55" relname="concession">Nida brings in the reminder that while there are no such things as " identical equivalents " in translating ,</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="95" relname="span">what one must in translating seek to do is find the " closest natural equivalent " .</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="111" relname="span">Here he identifies two basic orientations in translating based on two different types of equivalence :</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="96" relname="contrast">Formal Equivalence ( F-E )</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="96" relname="contrast">and Dynamic Equivalence ( D-E ) .</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="97" relname="span">F-E focuses attention on the message itself , in both form and content .</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="59" relname="elaboration">Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry , sentence to sentence , and concept to concept .</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="97" relname="elaboration">Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a " gloss translation " in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original .</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="98" relname="preparation">The principles governing an F-E translation would then be :</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="98" relname="joint">reproduction of grammatical units ;</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="98" relname="joint">consistency in word usage ;</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="98" relname="joint">and meanings in terms of the source context .</segment>
