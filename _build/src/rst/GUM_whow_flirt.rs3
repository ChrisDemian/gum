		<segment id="3" parent="129" relname="joint">and you do n't want to look like a creep ?</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="129" relname="evaluation">Congratulations — by seeking help , you 've already demonstrated more self-awareness than the vast majority of online flirts .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="108" relname="restatement">See Step 1 below to start flirting smartly and respectfully .</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="108" relname="restatement">Part 1 of 2 : Flirting Dos</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="71" relname="span">Start the conversation casually .</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="127" relname="motivation">As in the real world , the first step to flirting is to get over your cold feet and jump right in !</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="128" relname="span">Text the other person a brief message asking them about their day , asking them a specific question about work or school , or simply saying " Hi ! " .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="motivation">The hardest part of flirting is to break through your initial reluctance ,</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="12" relname="circumstance">so if you 're having a hard time taking the plunge</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="72" relname="span">, just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes , it 'll be less stressful than an equivalent real-world encounter .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="76" relname="span">There 's no reason to be nervous when it comes to IM flirting —</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="126" relname="condition">if the person you want to talk to does n't want to talk to you</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="126" relname="span">, s/he always has the option of simply not responding to your message</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="justify">, as , from your point of view , this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="130" relname="circumstance">This being said , if you barely know someone ,</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="130" relname="span">it can be a good idea to have an excuse for starting a conversation to avoid awkwardness .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="83" relname="span">Asking for help with a work or school-related problem is almost always a good bet , as is asking a question about something striking about the person .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="21" relname="circumstance">For instance , if the person has a band-related username</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="74" relname="span">, you might say : " Hey , cool name . Did you see those guys when they last came to town ? "</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="79" relname="span">Start small talk .</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="24" relname="circumstance">After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries ,</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="115" relname="span">you 'll probably want to ask how the person 's doing ( just like you might in the real world ) .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="77" relname="joint">Ask him or her about work or school , his / her interests , or any recent trips , for instance .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="77" relname="joint">Rather than asking a question , you can also simply offer your comments on these things .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="28" relname="circumstance">When s/he responds ,</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="116" relname="span">add your own comments or ask follow-up questions and proceed from there !</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="82" relname="span">Do n't pry into his or her personal life</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="29" relname="elaboration">— keep things light , fun , and focused on worry-free subjects .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="121" relname="span">Do n't dwell too long on small talk .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="80" relname="contrast">A minute or two is great for breaking the ice ,</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="80" relname="contrast">but much more can get boring fast .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="131" relname="sequence">For example , after we 've opened up by asking about this person 's interest in the band in his / her username ,</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="131" relname="sequence">it 's logical and reasonable to ask about this person 's musical likes and dislikes .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="84" relname="span">You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions .</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="36" relname="elaboration">For instance , you might say something like : " If you like those guys , you might want to check out this band called Manic Albatross - they 're like the Beatles , only darker . What sorts of other bands do you like ? "</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="89" relname="span">Joke .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="113" relname="span">Everyone likes a good sense of humor .</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="88" relname="restatement">In the immortal words of Marilyn Monroe , " If you can make a woman laugh , you can make her do anything "</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="42" relname="preparation">( do n't worry , ladies —</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="132" relname="span">the same is true for men ! )</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="90" relname="span">Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic as you respond to the statements of the person you 're talking to .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="45" relname="condition">For instance , if you 're asked what you 're up to ,</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="123" relname="span">rather than saying , " looking for people to hit on on Facebook " you might find that it 's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like " writing the great American novel " or " drowning my sorrows " .</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="123" relname="motivation">These responses have the added benefit of being natural launching points for conversations about your hobbies , like the writing you 're doing on the side and the great bourbon you tasted the other day .</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="120" relname="span">In our example conversation , you might work a joke or two into your music-related small talk .</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="47" relname="elaboration">For instance , you might say something like , " I do n't know why every song on the radio nowadays has a Texas Flynn feature . Does he even have time to record between rehab stints ? "</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="106" relname="preparation">Part 2 of 2 : Flirting Don'ts</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="85" relname="restatement">Do n't be too self-deprecating .</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="85" relname="restatement">Simply put , confidence is sexy .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="87" relname="span">This is more true for real-life situations than it is online</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="52" relname="concession">, but this mantra has some truth in the world of IM flirting as well .</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="92" relname="restatement">For instance , you 'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense .</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="92" relname="restatement">Just one is plenty</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="92" relname="restatement">— it should n't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation .</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="92" relname="motivation">Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one in which you appear needy and self-loathing .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="94" relname="span">On the other hand , this is n't to say that you should necessarily make jokes at other people 's expense</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="58" relname="motivation">, as this can make you seem mean and petty .</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="117" relname="restatement">Any sort of pointed or caustic remarks about yourself or someone else do n't have a place in flirtatious conversations .</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="122" relname="span">Do n't be too sappy .</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="125" relname="justify">People like flirting to be fun .</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="133" relname="span">For most people , receiving compliments is only fun up to a point —</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="63" relname="elaboration">getting more than one or two can make someone feel embarrassed and self-conscious .</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="95" relname="joint">It can also make him or her question your motives , leading the person to believe that you may be trying to get something out of him or her .</segment>
		<segment id="66" parent="95" relname="joint">Besides , the wooing power of flowery , gushing compliments is diminished ( to say the least ) when the compliments are displayed in a tiny box at the bottom of the screen alongside cartoon smiley faces .</segment>
		<segment id="67" parent="68" relname="antithesis">Instead of relying too heavily on compliments</segment>
		<segment id="68" parent="98" relname="span">, instead , focus on having an engaging , genuine conversation .</segment>
		<segment id="69" parent="99" relname="restatement">Follow the mantra " show , do n't tell . "</segment>
		<segment id="70" parent="99" relname="restatement">In other words , show that you 're attracted to this person by giving him or her a great conversation , not by stating it outright .</segment>
