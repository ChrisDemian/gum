		<segment id="11" parent="97" relname="span">Around 4 July 1831 , Poisson declared Galois ' work " incomprehensible " ,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">declaring that " [ Galois ' ] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor " ;</segment>

		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="evidence">" We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion . " [ 16 ]</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="16" relname="concession">While Poisson 's report was made before Galois ' July 14 arrest ,</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="98" relname="span">it took until October to reach Galois in prison .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="121" relname="contrast">It is unsurprising , in the light of his character and situation at the time , that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter , and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier .</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="122" relname="span">Apparently , however , Galois did not ignore Poisson 's advice ,</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="123" relname="span">as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="19" relname="circumstance">while still in prison ,</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="124" relname="joint">and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832 , [ 12 ] after which he was somehow talked into a duel . [ 8 ]</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="84" relname="span">Galois ' fatal duel took place on 30 May . [ 17 ]</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="125" relname="restatement">The true motives behind the duel are obscure .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="125" relname="restatement">There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="87" relname="background">What is known is that five days before his death , he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair . [ 7 ]</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="85" relname="span">Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel , [ 18 ] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life .</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="26" relname="elaboration">Fragments of letters from her , copied by Galois himself ( with many portions , such as her name , either obliterated or deliberately omitted ) , are available . [ 19 ]</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="88" relname="span">The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois ,</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="89" relname="span">and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf .</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="90" relname="preparation">This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="90" relname="joint">Galois ' cousin , Gabriel Demante , when asked if he knew the cause of the duel , mentioned that Galois " found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé , each of whom provoked the duel . "</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="90" relname="joint">Galois himself famously exclaimed : " I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes . " [ 12 ]</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="103" relname="contrast">Much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois ' biographers ( most notably by Eric Temple Bell in Men of Mathematics ) , such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy . [ 14 ]</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="91" relname="span">As to his opponent in the duel , Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville , [ 13 ] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois ' first arrest . [ 20 ]</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="92" relname="span">However , Dumas is alone in this assertion ,</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="37" relname="condition">and if he were correct</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="93" relname="span">it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="75" relname="span">It has been speculated that he might have been du Motel 's " supposed fiancé " at the time</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="38" relname="background">( she ultimately married someone else ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="127" relname="contrast">but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="105" relname="contrast">On the other hand , extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent ( identified by the initials " L. D. " ) that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois ' Republican friends , most probably Ernest Duchatelet , who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges . [ 21 ]</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="105" relname="result">Given the conflicting information available , the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history .</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="44" relname="concession">Whatever the reasons behind the duel ,</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="107" relname="span">Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament , the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas , and three attached manuscripts . [ 22 ]</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="107" relname="evaluation">Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament , " This letter , if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains , is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind . "</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="108" relname="concession">However , the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated . [ 7 ]</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="110" relname="elaboration">In these final papers , he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers .</segment>

		<segment id="54" parent="112" relname="span">His funeral ended in riots . [ 17 ]</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="79" relname="span">There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral ,</segment>
