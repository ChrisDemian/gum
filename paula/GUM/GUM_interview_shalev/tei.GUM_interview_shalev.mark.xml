		<!--First of all I think maybe they have bad teachers , which is a problem . You have to have very good teachers in mathematics if you really want to enjoy and to succeed in it . Probably some people mainly think about the scientific part of it – you have to be accurate - and they see less these elements of the freedom , and the imagination , and creation . Maybe they do n't like the precise nature of mathematics . Also when I talk mathematics I notice the language is very important in mathematics and I actually notice that many times people fail in mathematics because they do n't know how to write a composition . They have ideas but they can not formulate them in the right way . Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature because almost all the thing I told about mathematics are also seen in literature and in writing because when you write you can describe the real world , but you can also create worlds of fiction . So you have imagination , you have total freedom , you can invent characters , you can invent all kind of development and surprises and this kind of end of story or another . Also the language is important in writing and in literature . So in a way people often do n't know how to combine the two fields . It could look like almost the opposite : literature is kind of arts and mathematics is science but they also see a lot in common and there where mathematician who were writers . For example the most famous is Lewis Carrol , author of Alice in Wonderland .-->

I 'm a little bit inspired by dreams but when eventually I started to write more seriously I was more interested in structure which also .. a bit like mathematics in a way .. for example my first book is called Opus 1 .. a collection of four long stories with musical structures . The first part is called Legato and the second part was called Staccato . In the legato part the sentences are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness . In the staccato part it 's like a music : a lot of break , very very short sentences . It was a bit experimenting connections between the language and the music and the psychology of people . In the second book I made another experiment . It 's a book of opening , Overtures I called it , and there is no end to the stories . There are seventy beginning of stories without ends . In the novel Dark Matters I think what interested me in the structure was two thing : simple narrative and email . It keeps changing between narrative and email . Another thing was two different time scapes : one goes very slow and one goes very fast and they almost kind of meet in the end . It 's a little bit like Achilles and the turtle . ... love story and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this but also this structure interested me a lot .-->
