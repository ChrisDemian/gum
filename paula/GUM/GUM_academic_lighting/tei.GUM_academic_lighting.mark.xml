		<!--One of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb . The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage . There are three general types of lighting that are widely used in the household nowadays : the ( light-emitting diode ) LED bulb , ( compact fluorescent light ) CFL bulb and the incandescent bulb . But each of them has their perks and perils [ 3 ] . Unfortunately , most of the time , people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary . Today , CFLs are the most used lighting sources in the household . Using CFLs will allow people to decrease their energy consumption ; also it is a good start to decrease greenhouse emissions . However , the main problem of CFLs is the mercury they contain .-->
