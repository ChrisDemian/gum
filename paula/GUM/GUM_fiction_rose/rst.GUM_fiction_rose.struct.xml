The outfit he had chosen , khaki pants and a blue button-down shirt <hyphen><hyphen> no tie <hyphen><hyphen> lay neatly folded on the bed . He stood before Rachel in his plain white underwear and white socks , gazing at her as if she were a mirror . " No , " she said . It was the first time she had been to his apartment , and she stood square in the center of his bedroom , her arms folded against her body as if she was afraid to sit down , to touch something . " Why ? " " My father will like you , " she said . " But he likes everyone . My mother 's more particular <hyphen><hyphen> she thinks that you lack a serious nature . " Carroll put on his pants , admiring the crease . " So you 've talked to her about me . " " Yes . " " But you have n't talked about her to me . " " No . " " Are you ashamed of her ? " Rachel snorted . Then she sighed in a way that seemed to suggest she was regretting her decision to take him home . " You 're ashamed of me , " he guessed , and Rachel kissed him and smiled and did n't say anything . Rachel still lived on her parents ' farm , which made it all the more remarkable that she had kept Carroll and her parents apart for so long . It suggested a talent for daily organization that filled Carroll 's heart with admiration and lust . She was nineteen , two years younger than Carroll ; she was a student at Jellicoh College and every weekday she rose at seven and biked four miles into town , and then back again on her bike , four miles uphill to the farm .-->
