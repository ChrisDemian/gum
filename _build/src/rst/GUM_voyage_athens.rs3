		<segment id="24" parent="97" relname="span">Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics ( from new freeways to light rail systems ) , the city 's historic center underwent serious renovation .</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="24" relname="elaboration">Most notable among the city 's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city 's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pláka districts .</segment>

		<segment id="32" parent="65" relname="span">the city 's political , economic , and cultural importance had declined over the centuries , leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times .</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="69" relname="span">With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens , architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins , with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings , large city squares , green spaces , and wide avenues , making a conscious , decisive turn from the city 's Ottoman past .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="78" relname="span">The city regained its importance in Greek civilization , and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city , with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation 's past .</segment>

		<segment id="39" parent="102" relname="span">In the 1960s and 1970s , many 19th century neoclassical buildings , often small and private , were demolished</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="39" relname="purpose">to make way for office buildings , often designed by great Greek architects .</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="76" relname="span">The city also expanded outward through rash development , particularly towards the west ,</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="cause">as its population grew by absorbing job-seekers from the provinces .</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="44" relname="background">With the onset of the automobile , public officials reduced the city 's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s .</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="73" relname="span">By the late 1980s and early 1990s , the city 's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials</segment>

		<segment id="53" parent="52" relname="concession">but this rarely happens .</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="55" relname="concession">Winter is definitely low season , with the occasional rainy or snowy day ,</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="68" relname="span">but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists .</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="57" relname="concession">Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads ,</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="71" relname="span">on most sunny days the skies are azure blue .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="105" relname="span">The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave .</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="58" relname="solutionhood">The government 's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin .</segment>
