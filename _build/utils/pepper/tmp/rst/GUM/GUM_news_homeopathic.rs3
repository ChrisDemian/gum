		<segment id="5" parent="62" relname="span">after they shunned effective conventional medical treatments for homeopathy , a form of alternative medicine that has been described as pseudoscience .</segment>

		<segment id="13" parent="12" relname="result">leading to severe malnutrition and , eventually , her death .</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="45" relname="joint">By the end , Gloria 's eczema was so severe that her skin broke every time her parents changed her clothes or nappy ,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="45" relname="joint">and in the words of the Crown prosecutor , Mark Tedeschi , QC , " Gloria spent a lot of the last five months of her life crying , irritable , scratching and the only thing that gave her solace was to suck on her mother 's breast . "</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="45" relname="joint">Gloria also became unable to move her legs .</segment>

		<segment id="35" parent="57" relname="span">they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences .</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="58" relname="span">Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that , if given to a healthy person undiluted , would cause symptoms similar to the disease .</segment>
