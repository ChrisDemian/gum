		<segment id="2" parent="1" relname="elaboration">A Comparative Discourse Analysis of Fan Responses to Game of Thrones</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="4" relname="preparation">It is no exaggeration to say that HBO ’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand :</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="41" relname="span">it is a transmedia system in the sense first used by Marsha Kinder ( 1991 ) and popularized by Henry Jenkins ( 2006 ) , in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “ storyworld ” of an original production .</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="6" relname="background">Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes , with an average global viewership ( from its most recent season ) of 25.1 million viewers per episode ( Shepherd , 2016 ) ,</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="62" relname="span">it has spawned five video games , a graphic novel adaptation , several companion books , two rap albums , a 28-city orchestral tour , a wide variety of tabletop games , toys , merchandise and mobile apps , and countless podcasts , fanfics and other fan-based creations .</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="8" relname="cause">Given the volume of content this represents ,</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="40" relname="span">it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom .</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="42" relname="span">As such , the Game of Thrones storyworld represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new , who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives .</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="43" relname="span">In this sense , fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored .</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="12" relname="background">Transmedia systems , like that exemplified by Game of Thrones , are becoming increasingly prevalent ( e.g. , Star Wars , Harry Potter , The Walking Dead , the Marvel Cinematic Universe , etc ) ;</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="44" relname="span">these systems demonstrate , in microcosm , the global challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society .</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="45" relname="span">The study of how people , as fans , access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry , but to the wider context of cultural studies ,</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user .</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="47" relname="span">For us , as digital humanists , defining the “ transmedia fan ” is of particular relevance</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="cause">as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations engendered by digital technologies .</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="57" relname="preparation">Methodology</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="57" relname="span">As a first step in defining the “ transmedia fan ” , the current project undertakes a comparative discourse analysis of online conversations of Game of Thrones fans .</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="49" relname="background">One of the most dramatic plot developments in the source material ( Martin , 2000 ) was adapted to the screen in the penultimate episode of the third season , “ The Rains of Castamere ” ( Benioff &amp; Weiss , 2013 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="49" relname="contrast">Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “ Red Wedding ” ,</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="49" relname="contrast">while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin ’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode .</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="23" relname="preparation">Since the television series ’ inception , writers at The AV Club have written two critical reviews for each episode :</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="66" relname="span">one for viewers familiar with the books ( i.e. , “ Experts ” ) and one for viewers unfamiliar with the books and averse to “ spoilers ” ( i.e. , “ Newbies ” ) .</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="50" relname="span">What results are two completely separate reviews of “ The Rains of Castamere ” which in turn document the fans ’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads :</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="24" relname="elaboration">one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it .</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="51" relname="span">As a pilot project , the current work takes the content of both comment threads — a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments — and analyzes each thread separately</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="26" relname="elaboration">using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory ( Charmaz , 2006 ) .</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="56" relname="span">Through this analysis , a categorization of themes emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans .</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="30" relname="preparation">These themes fall under two broad categories :</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="53" relname="span">negotiation ( i.e. , emotional responses ) and tactical negotiation ( i.e. , cognitive , or reasoned responses ) .</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="68" relname="sequence">A comparison of categories and sub-categories between both groups provides preliminary findings to support an emergent model , or models , of the “ transmedia fan ” .</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="70" relname="preparation">Conclusion</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="72" relname="span">The present research represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems , as exemplified by Game of Thrones , through the study of fans .</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="69" relname="joint">The question posed by this research is , fundamentally , an examination of how the problem of “ access ” is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer .</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="61" relname="span">Future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="59" relname="span">using the principles of De Certeau ’s ( 1984 ) everyday life practice ,</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="36" relname="purpose">in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern-day consumers .</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="69" relname="joint">The current study will contribute to the development of further qualitative and quantitative research that will more clearly define the information behaviors of the transmedia fan .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="72" relname="evaluation">This project is of relevance to researchers in media studies , fan studies , information studies and digital humanities .</segment>
