		<!--Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale , although he continued to spend time in political activities . After his expulsion became official in January 1831 , he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest , but this waned , as it seemed that his political activism had priority . [ 4 ] [ 7 ] Siméon Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations , which he did on 17 January 1831 . Around 4 July 1831 , Poisson declared Galois ' work " incomprehensible " , declaring that " [ Galois ' ] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor " ; however , the rejection report ends on an encouraging note : " We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion . " [ 16 ] While Poisson 's report was made before Galois ' July 14 arrest , it took until October to reach Galois in prison . It is unsurprising , in the light of his character and situation at the time , that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter , and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier . Apparently , however , Galois did not ignore Poisson 's advice , as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison , and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832 , [ 12 ] after which he was somehow talked into a duel .

[ 19 ] The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois , and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf . This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died . Galois ' cousin , Gabriel Demante , when asked if he knew the cause of the duel , mentioned that Galois " found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé , each of whom provoked the duel . " Galois himself famously exclaimed : " I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes . " [ 12 ]-->
