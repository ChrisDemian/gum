		<!--A tourist visa card ( visa de tarjeta del turista ) is necessary for travelers from most nations . This visa , which is really little more than a piece of paper on which you list your vital statistics , costs between 15 - 25 CUC ( or € 15 - 25 ) , depending on where purchased . It can be purchased at the Airport in Cuba on arrival , however it should be noted that many airlines will require a valid tourist visa card before boarding flights . It is usually valid for 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days at any immigration office in Cuba ( for 25 CUC ) - beyond this you would need a flight out of Cuba within the extended visa period . Canadians are the exception , getting 90 days on arrival and can apply for a 90 day extension . Your passport needs to be valid at least six months past the end of your planned return . Canadian passports must be valid for at least one month beyond the date of expected departure ( [ 2 ] ) .-->
