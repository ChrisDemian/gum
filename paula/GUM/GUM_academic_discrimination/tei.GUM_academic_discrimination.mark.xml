		<!--Our exploratory study included three basic steps . First , summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced . Second , we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category . Finally , we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories . In order to examine potential bivariate associations , the adjusted F statistic ( design-based F ) was employed as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health . [ 21 ] More specifically , when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “ an F statistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott ( 1981 [ 22 ] , 1984 [ 23 ] ) correction ” . [ 24 ] The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic ) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data . This final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination . As noted earlier , all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategy . Thus , all estimates reported here can be considered nationally representative of the United States .-->
