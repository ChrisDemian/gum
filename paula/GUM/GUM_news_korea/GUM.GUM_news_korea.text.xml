<body>North Korea puts military in &apos; quasi-state of war &apos; Friday , August 21 , 2015 According to Yonhap news agency , quoting North Korea &apos;s main news agency Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) , the country &apos;s military has been placed on high alert and has been told to prepare a &quot; quasi-state of war &quot; . The report comes after North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire yesterday . &quot; War maniacs of the South Korean puppet military made another grave provocation to the DPRK in the central western sector of the front on Thursday afternoon . They perpetrated such reckless action as firing 36 shells at KPA civil police posts under the absurd pretext that the KPA fired one shell at the south side . Six shells of them hit the area near KPA civil police posts 542 and 543 and other 15 shells fell near KPA civil police posts 250 and 251 &quot; , said KCNA . &quot; Foolhardy provocation deserves harsh punishment &quot; , it added ; and , later , &quot; Kim Jong-un issued an order of the supreme commander of the Korean People &apos;s Army [ KPA ] that the front-line large combined units of the KPA should enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations &quot; . Yesterday , North Korea fired artillery rounds aimed at a loudspeaker in South Korea that broadcasts anti-Pyongyang propaganda into the North . &quot; Commanders of the Korean People &apos;s Army were hastily dispatched to the front-line troops to command military operations to destroy psychological warfare tools if the enemy does not stop the propaganda broadcast within 48 hours and prepare against the enemy &apos;s possible counteractions &quot; , added KCNA . No injuries or deaths were reported in the attacks from either side , but South Korea evacuated about 80 people in the town of Yeoncheon after at least one shell landed near the area . The South retaliated by firing dozens of rounds of artillery into the north . South Korea had recently started to broadcast propaganda from loudspeakers after an 11-year lull . The broadcasts began on August 10 and South Korea says the broadcasts will continue . After the exchange of fire , North Korea stated it would attack any loudspeakers broadcasting propaganda and would respond , militarily , within 48 hours if the broadcasts do not stop . Both countries have put their militaries on high levels of alert . </body>
