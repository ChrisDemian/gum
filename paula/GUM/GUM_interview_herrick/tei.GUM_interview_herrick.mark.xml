[ Note : The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met ] Like Wikipedia , wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software . Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world . That said , we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects : We are much smaller . The English wikiHow has only 60 admins , compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia . As a result , wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors . We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good . This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation . We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations . Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons . ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity ) . In addition , we 've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral . ( http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral ) Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility . As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online .-->

I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world . Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful . I 've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow . My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow . eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world . eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software . When I ran eHow , the content was professionally produced and edited . This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets . However , paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices . You either 1 ) sacrifice on breadth and do n't produce the topics that wo n't interest advertisers , or 2 ) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n't cost much to write . I was n't interested in making either of these sacrifices , as I think the world 's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive . So ultimately I decided that eHow 's model would not build the resource I envisioned . When I discovered Wikipedia , I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs . So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow .-->

In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave . " If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere . This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license . This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community . I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far . My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others . That said , when we started out I did n't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver 's license . As a result , we made some mistakes along the path . In retrospect , I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC . At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects .-->
