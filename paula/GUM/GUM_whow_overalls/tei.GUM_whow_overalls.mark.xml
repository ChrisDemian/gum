		<!--Wash alone or with " like " clothing . It ’s best to wash adults ’ overalls alone , especially men ’s . However , it is okay to wash just a few items with them , like blue jeans . What you do n’t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps , like women ’s long sleeve shirts or kids ’ blankets . Think similar clothing , minus the twisty-ness . Just do the denim and canvas stuff together . Fasten the straps to the bib . If you did n’t know already , the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets . Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash . This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash . Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened . This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run . Do n’t skip it . Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they do n’t come loose . If your washing machine is worth its salt , it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it . All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience . Empty the pockets . Overalls have more pockets than pants . The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket . Kids put rocks , candy , and bugs in these . Men put cell phones and small tools in them . Women defy the laws of purse-space , so when it comes to bib pockets , the sky is the limit . Make sure all the pockets are empty . Move the strap adjusters around . You ’ve probably got them just the way you like them , but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally , the straps will last longer . Depending on the adjusters , you may be able to leave them a little loose too . The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles ( not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes ) . Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing . This is the same idea as rotating tires . You know about rotating your tires , do n't you ?-->
