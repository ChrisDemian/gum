[ 10 ] In many respects , researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias . [ 11 ] What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices . Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings , for example , are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members . [ 12 ] Indeed , the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are , at least to some appreciable amount , present in modern society . Even so , estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare ( see [ 13 – 14 ] ) . At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [ 15 ] , however , using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample , reported that approximately 33 % of respondents reported some form of discrimination ( see also , Gibbons et al.

The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large , nationally representative sample of adults from the United States . Additionally , the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences . Reason for discrimination . All respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically , those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question : “ What do you think was the main reason for these experiences ? ” Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categories . For the present analysis , these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories capturing the following options : race / ancestry / skin color ; gender ; age ; religion ; height or weight ; sexual orientation ; education or income ; physical disability ; and other . The following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis : race ; ancestry or national origin ; and shade of skin color . Additionally , because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences , the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing ( legitimate skip ) . Respondent race . Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews , we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview .

In the current study , those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as “ mixed race ” . Demographic variables . To provide information on the analytical sample as a whole , two additional demographic variables are included . First , age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents ' birth ( obtained from Wave 1 ) from the year of the interview at Wave 4 . Second , sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 ( 0 = female and 1 = male ) . Analytical plan . Our exploratory study included three basic steps . First , summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced . Second , we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category .

[ 24 ] The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate ( than the associated with the χ2 statistic ) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data . This final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination .
