		<!--North Oakland is a sweeping term , referring to just about everywhere north of Uptown and Lake Merritt . Many of the neighborhoods are commercial centers and absolute heaven for foodies or those who seek quieter surroundings than the hustle and bustle of Downtown and Chinatown . Temescal is a neighborhood that lies north-northwest from Downtown , centered along the reach of Telegraph Avenue , at and near 51st Street . Until the 1960s , a dominantly Italian-American neighborhood , it is now a much more diversified neighborhood , home to many restaurants , including some of the city 's best Korean and Ethiopian establishments . Northeast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies Rockridge , a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibes . It has lots of local boutiques and a diverse range of food at all prices and styles . Open-air markets , bookstores , and a BART station all its own make Rockridge another of many pleasant stops in North Oakland . South of Rockridge , and southeast of Temescal lies Piedmont Avenue , a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill ( Pill Hill ) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills , houses and trees . Another of North Oakland 's group of foodie spots , home to the city 's single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others ; cafes , ice cream , coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhood . East along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocks . Grand Lake and Lakeshore both share a friendly , suburban sort of feel . The Grand Lake Theater stands at the entrance to the neighborhood that bears its name , a matter of a few hundred feet from Lakeshore Avenue – both are diverse neighborhoods no matter what your budget , be it burgers or sandwiches or a full romantic evening , either of these twin-sister neighborhoods will make a pleasant time , by day or night .-->

		<!--West Oakland was once a burgeoning working-class neighborhood with its roots tracing as far back as the opening decades of the 19th century . It has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent past . Strangely , twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakes . After the 1906 earthquake , many San Franciscans relocated there , and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousands . With Loma Prieta in 1989 , the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed , and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhood 's original Victorian houses , and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhood . Though there are a few draws for the traveler , West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation .-->
