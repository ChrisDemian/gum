		<segment id="38" parent="108" relname="restatement">" I think America 's obsession with celebrity culture is as strong today as it was when Warhol was living " , said Gustafon .</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="107" relname="span">" People are still intrigued by how stars live , dress and socialize ,</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="39" relname="cause">since it is so different from most people 's every day lives . "</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="110" relname="span">Wilkins explained Warhol 's obsession with celebrities began when he first collected head shots as a kid and continued as a passion throughout his life .</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="elaboration">" He 's hanging out with the celebrities , and has kind of become the same sort of celebrity he was interested in documenting earlier in his career " , Wilkins said .</segment>

		<segment id="47" parent="133" relname="preparation">Warhol 's photographic legacy</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="133" relname="joint">Warhol was close to important touchstones of the 1960s , including art , music , consumer culture , fashion , and celebrity worship , which were all buzzwords and images Wikinews observed at USI 's opening exhibit .</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="160" relname="span">He was also an influential figure in the pop art movement .</segment>
		<segment id="50" parent="51" relname="background">" Pop art was about what popular American culture really thought was important " , Kathryn Waters said .</segment>
		<segment id="51" parent="131" relname="span">" That 's why he did the Campbell Soup cans or the Marilyn pictures , these iconic products of American culture whether they be in film , video or actually products we consumed .</segment>
		<segment id="52" parent="132" relname="span">So even back in the sixties , he was very aware of this part of our culture .</segment>
		<segment id="53" parent="52" relname="elaboration">Which as we all know in 2014 , has only increased probably a thousand fold . "</segment>
		<segment id="54" parent="133" relname="joint">" I think everybody knows Andy Warhol 's name , even non-art people , that 's a name they might know because he was such a personality " , Water said .</segment>
		<segment id="55" parent="135" relname="span">Hilary Braysmith , USI associate professor of art history , said , " I think his photography is equally influential as his graphic works , his more famous pictures of Marilyn .</segment>
		<segment id="56" parent="55" relname="evaluation">In terms of the evolution of photography and experimentation , like painting on them or the celebrity fascination , I think he was really ground-breaking in that regard . "</segment>
		<segment id="57" parent="58" relname="concession">The Polaroid format is not what made Warhol famous , however , he is in the company of other well-known photographers who used the camera , such as Ansel Adams , Chuck Close , Walker Evans , Robert Mapplethorpe , and Helmut Newton .</segment>
		<segment id="58" parent="161" relname="span">Wilkins said , " [ Warhol ] liked the way photo booths and the Polaroid 's front flash looked " .</segment>
		<segment id="59" parent="137" relname="span">She explained how Warhol 's adoption of the Polaroid camera revealed his process .</segment>
		<segment id="60" parent="138" relname="span">According to Wilkins , Warhol was able to reproduce the Polaroid photograph and create an enlargement of it , which he then could use to commit the image to the silk screen medium by applying paint or manipulating them further .</segment>
		<segment id="61" parent="60" relname="elaboration">One of the silk screens exhibited at USI this time was the Annie Oakley screen print called " Cowboys and Indians " from 1987 .</segment>
		<segment id="62" parent="162" relname="span">Wilkins also said Warhol was both an artist and a businessperson .</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="140" relname="span">" As a way to commercialize his work , he would make a blue Marilyn and a pink Marilyn and a yellow Marilyn , and then you could pick your favorite color and buy that .</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="63" relname="evaluation">It was a very practical salesman approach to his work .</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="142" relname="span">He was very prolific but very business minded about that . "</segment>
		<segment id="66" parent="67" relname="cause">" He wanted to be rich and famous</segment>
		<segment id="67" parent="141" relname="span">and he made lots of choices to go that way " , Wilkins said .</segment>
		<segment id="68" parent="101" relname="preparation">USI exhibit</segment>
		<segment id="69" parent="70" relname="background">Kiara Perkins , a second year USI art major , admitted she was willing to skip class Thursday night to attend the opening exhibit but then circumstances allowed for her to attend the exhibit .</segment>
		<segment id="70" parent="99" relname="span">Why did she so badly want to attend ?</segment>
		<segment id="71" parent="167" relname="span">" It 's Warhol .</segment>
		<segment id="72" parent="71" relname="evaluation">He is a legend . "</segment>
		<segment id="73" parent="102" relname="restatement">For Kevin Allton , a USI instructor in English , Warhol was also a legend .</segment>
		<segment id="74" parent="75" relname="justify">He said , " Andy Warhol was the center of the Zeitgeist for the 20th century and everything since .</segment>
		<segment id="75" parent="102" relname="span">He is a post-modern diety . "</segment>
		<segment id="76" parent="104" relname="span">Allton said he had only seen the Silver Clouds installation before in film .</segment>
		<segment id="77" parent="76" relname="background">The Silver Clouds installation were silver balloons blown up with helium , and those balloons filled one of the smaller rooms in the gallery .</segment>
		<segment id="78" parent="103" relname="span">" I thought that in real life it was really kind of magical , " Allton said .</segment>
		<segment id="79" parent="78" relname="elaboration">" I smacked them around . "</segment>
		<segment id="80" parent="81" relname="preparation">Elements of the Zeitgeist were also playfully recreated on USI 's opening night .</segment>
		<segment id="81" parent="145" relname="span">In her opening remarks for attendees , Waters pointed out those features to attendees , noting the touches of the Warhol Factory , or the studio where he worked , that were present around them .</segment>
		<segment id="82" parent="144" relname="joint">She pointed to the refreshment table with Campbell 's Soup served with " electric " Kool Aid and tables adorned with colorful gumball " pills " .</segment>
		<segment id="83" parent="144" relname="joint">The music in the background was from such bands as The Velvet Underground .</segment>
		<segment id="84" parent="165" relname="span">The big hit of the evening , Wikinews observed from the long line , was the Polaroid-room where attendees could wear a Warhol-like wig or don crazy glasses and have their own Polaroid taken .</segment>
		<segment id="85" parent="146" relname="sequence">The Polaroids were ready in an instant and immediately displayed at the entry of the exhibit .</segment>
		<segment id="86" parent="166" relname="span">Exhibit goers then became part of the very exhibit they had wanted to attend .</segment>
		<segment id="87" parent="147" relname="span">In fact , many people Wikinews observed took out their mobiles as they left for the evening and used their own phone cameras to make one further record of the moment - a photo of a photo .</segment>
		<segment id="88" parent="98" relname="span">Perhaps they had learned an important lesson from the Warhol exhibit that cultural events like these were ripe for use and reuse .</segment>
		<segment id="89" parent="88" relname="elaboration">We might even call these exit instant snap shots , the self selfie .</segment>
